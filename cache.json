A variety of robotic systems have been developed to address this\nsocietal need. Unfortunately, end-user adoption of robot-assisted feeding is\nlimited, in part because existing devices are unable to seamlessly grasp,\nmanipulate, and feed diverse foods. Recent works seek to address this issue by\ncreating new algorithms for food acquisition and bite transfer. In parallel to\nthese algorithmic developments, however, we hypothesize that mechanical\nintelligence will make it fundamentally easier for robot arms to feed humans.\nWe therefore propose Kiri-Spoon, a soft utensil specifically designed for\nrobot-assisted feeding. Kiri-Spoon consists of a spoon-shaped kirigami\nstructure: when actuated, the kirigami sheet deforms into a bowl of increasing\ncurvature. Robot arms equipped with Kiri-Spoon can leverage the kirigami\nstructure to wrap-around morsels during acquisition, contain those items as the\nrobot moves, and then compliantly release the food into the user's mouth.\nOverall, Kiri-Spoon combines the familiar and comfortable shape of a standard\nspoon with the increased capabilities of soft robotic grippers. In what\nfollows, we first apply a stakeholder-driven design process to ensure that\nKiri-Spoon meets the needs of caregivers and users with physical disabilities.\nWe next characterize the dynamics of Kiri-Spoon, and derive a mechanics model\nto relate actuation force to the spoon's shape. The paper concludes with three\nseparate experiments that evaluate (a) the mechanical advantage provided by\nKiri-Spoon, (b) the ways users with disabilities perceive our system, and (c)\nhow the mechanical intelligence of Kiri-Spoon complements state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as\nqueries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention\nmap. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys\nor overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D\nGaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to\npreserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this\nquery formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs\nacross frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks\nrendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance\nsegmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation\nprobabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised\nby a panoptic loss.

A Microscopic Simulation Perspective","summary":"  Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have\nsparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a\nscenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without\nlanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This\npotentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However,\nthe transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises\nthe question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs,\nas these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over\nsystem-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through\nmicroscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines\n(PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following\nmodel. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent\ncollisions.

The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately\n60% CAVs in LFT is required before significant benefits of LFT start appearing\ncompared to a scenario with all HDVs.

Existing literature generally\naddresses bounded attack signals and/or bounded-first-order-derivative attack\nsignals, which exposes the CPSs to significant threats.

The attack-resilient compensators address the EU-FDI attacks on the OL\nand guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) estimation of the leaders'\nstates. Then, by using the compensators' states, fully-distributed\nattack-resilient controllers are designed on the CPL to further address the\nEU-FDI attacks on the actuators.

Although various applications of MVs have been\nexplored across different domains, their application in logistics remains\nunderexplored. This study examines the use of MVs in cargo delivery to reduce\ntotal delivery costs. We model the delivery problem for MVs as a variant of the\nVehicle Routing Problem, referred to as the Modular Vehicle Routing Problem\n(MVRP). In the MVRP, MVs can either serve customers independently or dock with\nother MVs to form a platoon, thereby reducing the average cost per unit. In\nthis study, we mainly focus on two fundamental types of MVRPs, namely the\ncapacitated MVRP and the MVRP with time windows. To address these problems, we\nfirst developed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models, which can be\nsolved using commercial optimization solvers. Given the NP-hardness of this\nproblem, we also designed a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm with a solution\nrepresentation based on Gantt charts and a neighborhood structure tailored for\nthe MVRP.

However, most of the existing methods only consider a\nsingle sparsity, which makes it difficult to select valuable and discriminative\nfeature subsets from the original high-dimensional feature set. In this paper,\nwe propose a new UFS method called DSCOFS via embedding double sparsity\nconstrained optimization into the classical principal component analysis (PCA)\nframework. Double sparsity refers to using $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm and $\\ell_0$-norm\nto simultaneously constrain variables, by adding the sparsity of different\ntypes, to achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of identifying\ndifferential features. The core is that $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm can remove irrelevant\nand redundant features, while $\\ell_0$-norm can filter out irregular noisy\nfeatures, thereby complementing $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm to improve discrimination. An\neffective proximal alternating minimization method is proposed to solve the\nresulting nonconvex nonsmooth model. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that\nthe sequence generated by our method globally converges to a stationary point.\nNumerical experiments on three synthetic datasets and eight real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and convergence of the proposed\nmethod. In particular, the average clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized\nmutual information (NMI) are improved by at least 3.34% and 3.02%,\nrespectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The update rule in the\nstandard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of\nupdates, treating all rewards equally without no bias. On the other hand, the\nrecent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD\nerror and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic.\nSuch biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and\nintentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this\nresearch explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity\nbetween the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a\ncontrol as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation\nencompassing various RL and optimal control methods. In particular, we\ninvestigate the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded\nin the derivation of the standard RL from control as inference.

The\nexisting grasp and manipulation taxonomies, however, often assume object\nrigidity, which limits their ability to reason about the complex interactions\nin the robotic manipulation of deformable objects. Hence, to assist in tasks\ninvolving deformable objects, taxonomies need to capture more comprehensively\nthe interactions inherent in deformable object manipulation. To this end, we\nintroduce T-DOM, a taxonomy that analyses key aspects involved in the\nmanipulation of deformable objects, such as robot motion, forces, prehensile\nand non-prehensile interactions and, for the first time, a detailed\nclassification of object deformations. To evaluate T-DOM, we curate a dataset\nof ten tasks involving a variety of deformable objects, such as garments,\nropes, and surgical gloves, as well as diverse types of deformations. We\nanalyse the proposed tasks comparing the T-DOM taxonomy with previous well\nestablished manipulation taxonomies. Our analysis demonstrates that T-DOM can\neffectively distinguish between manipulation skills that were not identified in\nother taxonomies, across different deformable objects and manipulation actions,\noffering new categories to characterize a skill.

This study investigates the effects of cognitive load on\nhuman trust within the context of a hybrid human-robot collaboration task. An\nexperiment is conducted where the humans and the robot, acting as team members,\ncollaboratively construct pyramids with differentiated levels of task\ncomplexity. Our findings reveal that cognitive load exerts diverse impacts on\nhuman trust in the robot. Notably, there is an increase in human trust under\nconditions of high cognitive load. Furthermore, the rewards for performance are\nsubstantially higher in tasks with high cognitive load compared to those with\nlow cognitive load, and a significant correlation exists between human trust\nand the failure risk of performance in tasks with low and medium cognitive\nload.

We evaluate\nLLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark\nfor household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than\na 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing\nsignificantly improved alignment with human preferences.

Despite this dilemma, the common practice of choosing batch sizes in\nlanguage model training often prioritizes training efficiency -- employing\neither constant large sizes with data parallelism or implementing batch size\nwarmup schedules. However, such batch size schedule designs remain heuristic\nand often fail to adapt to training dynamics, presenting the challenge of\ndesigning adaptive batch size schedules. Given the abundance of available\ndatasets and the data-hungry nature of language models, data parallelism has\nbecome an indispensable distributed training paradigm, enabling the use of\nlarger batch sizes for gradient computation. However, vanilla data parallelism\nrequires replicas of model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states at each\nworker, which prohibits training larger models with billions of parameters.

At each time, the goal of agents is to cooperatively\nfind a point in the constraint set such that the sum of local bifunctions with\na free variable is non-negative. Different from existing works, here the\nbifunctions and the constraint functions are time-varying and only available to\nagents after decisions are made. To tackle this problem, first, an online\ndistributed algorithm involving accurate gradient information is proposed based\non mirror descent algorithms and primal-dual strategies. Of particular interest\nis that dynamic regrets, whose offline benchmarks are to find the solution at\neach time, are employed to measure the performance of the algorithm. Under mild\nassumptions on the graph and the bifunctions, we prove that if the deviation in\nthe solution sequence grows within a certain rate, then both the dynamic regret\nand the violation of coupled inequality constraints increase sublinearly.\nSecond, considering the case where each agent only has access to a noisy\nestimate on the accurate gradient, we propose an online distributed algorithm\ninvolving the stochastic gradients. The result shows that under the same\nconditions as in the first case, if the noise distribution satisfies the\nsub-Gaussian condition, then dynamic regrets, as well as constraint violations,\nincrease sublinearly with high probability.

A range of\ntechniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already\ndeployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with\nchallenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and\nmanagement layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the\njoint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance\nwith standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This\narticle presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed\nand evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure)\ntestbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the\ntelecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules\nfrom multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The\nmodules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130\nkm of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict\nservice level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing\nclassical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility\nat all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and\nencryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was\nintended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of\nlarge-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of\nMadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases\nwere showcased.\n","authors":["Alberto Sebastián-Lombraña","Hans H.

During early iterations, LNS2+RL relies on MARL for low-level\nreplanning, which we show eliminates collisions much more than a PP algorithm.\nThere, our MARL-based planner allows agents to reason about past and future\ninformation to gradually learn cooperative decision-making through a finely\ndesigned curriculum learning. At later stages of planning, LNS2+RL adaptively\nswitches to PP algorithm to quickly resolve the remaining collisions, naturally\ntrading off solution quality (number of collisions in the solution) and\ncomputational efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on high-agent-density\ntasks across various team sizes, world sizes, and map structures consistently\ndemonstrate the superior performance of LNS2+RL compared to many MAPF\nalgorithms, including LNS2, LaCAM, EECBS, and SCRIMP. In maps with complex\nstructures, the advantages of LNS2+RL are particularly pronounced, with LNS2+RL\nachieving a success rate of over 50% in nearly half of the tested tasks, while\nthat of LaCAM, EECBS and SCRIMP falls to 0%.\n","authors":["Yutong Wang","Tanishq Duhan","Jiaoyang Li","Guillaume Sartoretti"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17794v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted for presentation at AAAI 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02580v2","updated":"2025-01-09T15:10:09Z","published":"2025-01-05T15:26:36Z","title":"LP-ICP: General Localizability-Aware Point Cloud Registration for Robust\n  Localization in Extreme Unstructured Environments","summary":"  The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is a crucial component of\nLiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. However, its performance can be negatively\naffected in unstructured environments that lack features and geometric\nstructures, leading to low accuracy and poor robustness in localization and\nmapping. It is known that degeneracy caused by the lack of geometric\nconstraints can lead to errors in 6-DOF pose estimation along ill-conditioned\ndirections. Therefore, there is a need for a broader and more fine-grained\ndegeneracy detection and handling method. This paper proposes a new point cloud\nregistration framework, LP-ICP, that combines point-to-line and point-to-plane\ndistance metrics in the ICP algorithm, with localizability detection and\nhandling. LP-ICP consists of a localizability detection module and an\noptimization module. The localizability detection module performs\nlocalizability analysis by utilizing the correspondences between edge points\n(with low local smoothness) to lines and planar points (with high local\nsmoothness) to planes between the scan and the map. The localizability\ncontribution of individual correspondence constraints can be applied to a\nbroader range. The optimization module adds additional soft and hard\nconstraints to the optimization equations based on the localizability category.\nThis allows the pose to be constrained along ill-conditioned directions, with\nupdates either tending towards the constraint value or leaving the initial\nestimate unchanged. This improves accuracy and reduces fluctuations. The\nproposed method is extensively evaluated through experiments on both simulation\nand real-world datasets, demonstrating higher or comparable accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

An ISM vessel reacts to other traffic participants according to maritime\ntraffic rules while at the same time solving a motion planning task\ncharacterized by waypoints. In particular, the ISM monitors the applicable\nrules, generates rule-compliant waypoints accordingly, and utilizes a model\npredictive control for tracking the waypoints.

Moreover, the underlying dynamics are often\nunknown and time-variant (e.g., payload, friction). In this paper, we introduce\nBAS (Bridging Adaptivity and Safety), which builds upon the pipeline of prior\nwork Agile But Safe (ABS)(He et al.) and is designed to provide adaptive safety\neven in dynamic environments with uncertainties. BAS involves an agile policy\nto avoid obstacles rapidly and a recovery policy to prevent collisions, a\nphysical parameter estimator that is concurrently trained with agile policy,\nand a learned control-theoretic RA (reach-avoid) value network that governs the\npolicy switch. Also, the agile policy and RA network are both conditioned on\nphysical parameters to make them adaptive. To mitigate the distribution shift\nissue, we further introduce an on-policy fine-tuning phase for the estimator to\nenhance its robustness and accuracy. The simulation results show that BAS\nachieves 50% better safety than baselines in dynamic environments while\nmaintaining a higher speed on average. In real-world experiments, BAS shows its\ncapability in complex environments with unknown physics (e.g., slippery floors\nwith unknown frictions, unknown payloads up to 8kg), while baselines lack\nadaptivity, leading to collisions or. degraded agility. As a result, BAS\nachieves a 19.8% increase in speed and gets a 2.36 times lower collision rate\nthan ABS in the real world.

However,\nconsidering the evolving nature of built environments, it is essential to\nquestion the capabilities of current mapping efforts in handling temporal\nchanges. In addition, spatiotemporal mapping holds significant potential for\nachieving sustainability and circularity goals. Existing mapping approaches\nfocus on small changes, such as object relocation or self-driving car\noperation; in all cases where the main structure of the scene remains fixed.\nConsequently, these approaches fail to address more radical changes in the\nstructure of the built environment, such as geometry and topology. To this end,\nwe introduce the Nothing Stands Still (NSS) benchmark, which focuses on the\nspatiotemporal registration of 3D scenes undergoing large spatial and temporal\nchange, ultimately creating one coherent spatiotemporal map. Specifically, the\nbenchmark involves registering two or more partial 3D point clouds (fragments)\nfrom the same scene but captured from different spatiotemporal views. In\naddition to the standard pairwise registration, we assess the multi-way\nregistration of multiple fragments that belong to any temporal stage.

To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to\nparticipate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does\nnot require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain\nexisting energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation\nof SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction\nstep during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the\nenergy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal\nservices (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more\nelectricity than they deposit without additional actions.

To mitigate the threat of wildfire ignitions from electric\npower infrastructure, many utilities preemptively de-energize power lines,\nwhich may result in power shutoffs. Data regarding wildfire ignition risks are\nkey inputs for effective planning of power line de-energizations. However,\nthere are multiple ways to formulate risk metrics that spatially aggregate\nwildfire risk map data, and there are different ways of leveraging this data to\nmake decisions. The key contribution of this paper is to define and compare the\nresults of employing six metrics for quantifying the wildfire ignition risks of\npower lines from risk maps, considering both threshold- and optimization-based\nmethods for planning power line de-energizations. The numeric results use the\nCalifornia Test System (CATS), a large-scale synthetic grid model with power\nline corridors accurately representing California infrastructure, in\ncombination with real Wildland Fire Potential Index data for a full year.

In many such\nsituations, the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales,\nmaking it difficult to learn the dynamics of a governing operator, but the bulk\ndistribution $\\mu_t^N$ approximates an absolutely continuous measure $\\mu_t$\nthat evolves ``smoothly.''

For\nonline learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the\nregret the algorithm incurs.

This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the\ncurrent period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower\ngeneration in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term\nCHP planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover\nstorage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit\nand future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the\nfuture value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i)\nconstructing a model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation\nthat a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii)\nextracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover\nstorage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to\nthe constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on\nthe extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can\nbe seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable\nmixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can\nbe easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally,\nnumerical results on a CHP system of Portland General Electric demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the presented framework in determining proper carryover\nstorage values to facilitate medium-term CHP planning.\n","authors":["Xianbang Chen","Yikui Liu","Zhiming Zhong","Neng Fan","Zhechong Zhao","Lei Wu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09876v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01615v2","updated":"2025-01-08T20:48:41Z","published":"2025-01-03T03:19:02Z","title":"Equity Impacts of Public Transit Network Redesign with Shared Autonomous\n  Mobility Services","summary":"  This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous\nmobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater\nChicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in\nmultimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs\n(equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas\n(equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones\nwith redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and\nthe existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between\ntransit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of\nSAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget.\nDifferential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the\ncity, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement\npotential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and\ncity areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also\ndisproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve\nvertical equity.

This paper identifies drivers of the ineffectiveness by analyzing the\nstructure of the reformulated problem and the strength of different branching\nschemes. Our analysis shows that the reformulated problem has an unfavorable\nstructure for column generation: It is highly degenerate, slowing down the\nconvergence of column generation, and for many project scheduling problems, it\nyields the same or only slightly stronger linear relaxations as classical\nformulations at the expense of large increases in runtime.

However, the transition to a green hydrogen economy faces a critical\nchallenge known as the `chicken-and-egg dilemma', wherein establishing a\nhydrogen supply network relies on demand, while demand only grows with reliable\nsupply.

This\npaper addresses these complex issues through a risk-averse framework with the\nintroduction of a distributionally robust hydrogen network expansion planning\nproblem under decision-dependent demand ambiguity. The problem optimizes\nlocation and production capacity decisions of the suppliers considering the\nmoments of the stochastic hydrogen demand as a function of these investment\ndecisions. To obtain tractable representations of this problem, we derive two\ndifferent reformulations that consider continuous and discrete hydrogen demand\nsupport sets under different forms of decision dependencies.

We conduct a user study ($N=60$) under an LfC setting where\nparticipants supervise and correct a robot performing pick-and-place tasks.

We establish that better\nload balancing of inference requests across the available LLM instances can\nimprove the end-to-end latency to a larger extent than merely focusing on\noptimizing the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by our findings, we propose\na heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for\ndata-driven and workload-aware scheduling. Our router schedules queries across\nLLM instances by leveraging a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel\nformulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads and\nachieves over 11% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches on a mix of\npublic datasets and 7.8% lower end-to-end latency on real workload data with\ndiverse input and output trends from Cloud Provider X. Additionally, the\nproposed framework can also serve as a standard for benchmarking different LLM\ninference schedulers since it provides the best latency for a given model,\nhardware, and instance-level scheduler combination.\n","authors":["Kunal Jain","Anjaly Parayil","Ankur Mallick","Esha Choukse","Xiaoting Qin","Jue Zhang","Íñigo Goiri","Rujia Wang","Chetan Bansal","Victor Rühle","Anoop Kulkarni","Steve Kofsky","Saravan Rajmohan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13510v2.pdf","comment":"16 pages, 10 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12235v3","updated":"2025-01-07T17:46:06Z","published":"2023-07-23T05:58:04Z","title":"Optimal Time-Invariant Distributed Formation Tracking for Second-Order\n  Multi-Agent Systems","summary":"  This paper addresses the optimal time-invariant formation tracking problem\nwith the aim of providing a distributed solution for multi-agent systems with\nsecond-order integrator dynamics.

Traffic congestion on expressways is a\nsevere issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize\ntraffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time\nshort-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic\nmonitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to\nthe sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing\nreal-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain\nspatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without\ndead zones.

The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which\ndevices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data\nhandling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation\nvalidates the proposed system.

Vision-based methods for surgical instrument pose estimation provide\na practical approach to tool tracking, but they often require markers to be\nattached to the instruments. Recently, more research has focused on the\ndevelopment of marker-less methods based on deep learning. However, acquiring\nrealistic surgical data, with ground truth instrument poses, required for deep\nlearning training, is challenging. To address the issues in surgical instrument\npose estimation, we introduce the Surgical Robot Instrument Pose Estimation\n(SurgRIPE) challenge, hosted at the 26th International Conference on Medical\nImage Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023. The\nobjectives of this challenge are: (1) to provide the surgical vision community\nwith realistic surgical video data paired with ground truth instrument poses,\nand (2) to establish a benchmark for evaluating markerless pose estimation\nmethods. The challenge led to the development of several novel algorithms that\nshowcased improved accuracy and robustness over existing methods. The\nperformance evaluation study on the SurgRIPE dataset highlights the potential\nof these advanced algorithms to be integrated into robotic surgery systems,\npaving the way for more precise and autonomous surgical procedures.

This transformation facilitates the formulation of\ncustomized, decoupled link-specific constraints, which is further solved\nefficiently with augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming\n(AL-DDP). Our approach naturally absorbs spatial kinematic propagation in the\nforward pass and processes all link-specific constraints simultaneously during\nthe backward pass, enhancing both constraint management and computational\nefficiency.

To protect legitimate\ncommunication in a chaotic UAV environment, where both eavesdropping and\njamming become straightforward from multiple adversaries with line-of-sight\nsignal propagation, a new reliable and integrated physical layer security\nmechanism is proposed in this paper for a massive\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) UAV system. Particularly, a physical\nlayer fingerprint, also called a tag, is first embedded into each message for\nauthentication purpose. We then propose to reuse the tag additionally as a\nreference to encode each message to ensure secrecy for confidentiality\nenhancement at a low cost. Specifically, we create a new dual-reference\nsymmetric tag generation mechanism by inputting an encoding-insensitive feature\nof plaintext along with the key into a hash function. At a legitimate receiver,\nan expected tag, reliable for decoding, can be symmetrically regenerated based\non the received ciphertext, and authentication can be performed by comparing\nthe regenerated reference tag to the received tag. However, an illegitimate\nreceiver can only receive the fuzzy tag which can not be used to decode the\nreceived message. Additionally, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to degrade\neavesdropping to further decrease message leakage.

Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical\ndistribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission\nnodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs\n(M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows\nis a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to\nDERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the\ndistribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in\nindustry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC\n(CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs,\ntreated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against\naggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are\nmodeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging\nhistorical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space.\nWith this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which\nis reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders\ndecomposition.

To\nlearn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning\n(COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using\nBayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the\nconjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance\nimprovement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the\nsteady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We\npresent COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations\nshow that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing\nenvironment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current\nreinforcement learning techniques.\n","authors":["Kim Hammar","Tao Li","Rolf Stadler","Quanyan Zhu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12499v4.pdf","comment":"This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03508v3","updated":"2025-01-05T10:05:05Z","published":"2024-08-07T02:19:17Z","title":"SemiEpi: Self-driving, Closed-loop Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor\n  Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning","summary":"  The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks\nthrough closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the\noptimization of complex multi-step processes.

Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on regular boundaries, often assuming that their\ngeometric equations are known in advance, which is not often the case in\npractice. In this paper, we investigate a more general case and propose an\nalgorithm that addresses geometric irregularities of boundaries without\nrequiring prior knowledge of their analytical expressions. To achieve this, we\ndevelop a Fourier-based curve fitting method for boundary approximation using\nsampled points, enabling parametric characterization of general 2-D boundaries.\nThis approach allows star-shaped boundaries to be fitted into polar-angle-based\nparametric curves, while boundaries of other shapes are handled through\ndecomposition. Then, we design a vector field (VF) to achieve the encirclement\nof the parameterized boundary, wherein a polar radius error is introduced to\nmeasure the robot's ``distance'' to the boundary.

In the considered problem, only a small set of UAVs, named\nleaders, can obtain their global positions, and the other UAVs only have access\nto bearing information relative to their neighbors. To address the problem, we\npropose novel schemes by integrating the distributed bearing-based\nself-localization algorithm and the observer-based affine formation tracking\ncontroller. The designed localization algorithm estimates the global position\nby using inter-UAV bearing measurements, and the observer-based controller\ntracks the desired formation with the estimated positions. A key distinction of\nour approach is extending the SLAFT control scheme to the bearing-based\ncoordination of nonholonomic UAV systems, where the desired inter-UAV bearings\ncan be time-varying, instead of constant ones assumed in most of the existing\nresults. Two control schemes with different convergence rates are designed to\nmeet desired task requirements under different conditions.

Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value.\nConventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to\nre-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which,\nhowever, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of\nmanaging runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of\nthe authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing\nliterature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to\nrecover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the\nsystem's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to\nmodify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints.

The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance.

Specifically, the\nresults show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM\nbased Newton's method) $\\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than\nthe OCR method.
