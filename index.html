                                        <span>  Learning policies in simulation and transferring them to the real world has
become a promising approach in dexterous manipulation. However, bridging the
sim-to-real gap for each new task requires substantial human effort, such as
careful reward engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and system identification.
In this work, we present a system that leverages low-level skills to address
these challenges for more complex tasks. Specifically, we introduce a
hierarchical policy for in-hand object reorientation based on previously
acquired rotation skills. This hierarchical policy learns to select which
low-level skill to execute based on feedback from both the environment and the
low-level skill policies themselves. Compared to learning from scratch, the
hierarchical policy is more robust to out-of-distribution changes and transfers
easily from simulation to real-world environments. Additionally, we propose a
generalizable object pose estimator that uses proprioceptive information,
low-level skill predictions, and control errors as inputs to estimate the
object pose over time. We demonstrate that our system can reorient objects,
including symmetrical and textureless ones, to a desired pose.

                                        <span>  We present RoboPanoptes, a capable yet practical robot system that achieves
whole-body dexterity through whole-body vision. Its whole-body dexterity allows
the robot to utilize its entire body surface for manipulation, such as
leveraging multiple contact points or navigating constrained spaces. Meanwhile,
whole-body vision uses a camera system distributed over the robot's surface to
provide comprehensive, multi-perspective visual feedback of its own and the
environment's state. At its core, RoboPanoptes uses a whole-body visuomotor
policy that learns complex manipulation skills directly from human
demonstrations, efficiently aggregating information from the distributed
cameras while maintaining resilience to sensor failures. Together, these design
aspects unlock new capabilities and tasks, allowing RoboPanoptes to unbox in
narrow spaces, sweep multiple or oversized objects, and succeed in multi-step
stowing in cluttered environments, outperforming baselines in adaptability and
efficiency. Results are best viewed on https://robopanoptes.github.io.

                                        <span>  Continuum instruments are integral to robot-assisted minimally invasive
surgery (MIS), with tendon-driven mechanisms being the most common. Real-time
tension feedback is crucial for precise articulation but remains a challenge in
compact actuation unit designs. Additionally, accurate shape and external force
sensing of continuum instruments are essential for advanced control and
manipulation. This paper presents a compact and modular actuation unit that
integrates a torque cell directly into the pulley module to provide real-time
tension feedback. Building on this unit, we propose a novel shape-force sensing
framework that incorporates polynomial curvature kinematics to accurately model
non-constant curvature. The framework combines pose sensor measurements at the
instrument tip and actuation tension feedback at the developed actuation unit.
Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed
shape-force sensing framework in terms of shape reconstruction accuracy and
force estimation reliability compared to conventional constant-curvature
methods.

                                        <span>  Q-learning methods are widely used in robot path planning but often face
challenges of inefficient search and slow convergence. We propose an Improved
Q-learning (IQL) framework that enhances standard Q-learning in two significant
ways. First, we introduce the Path Adaptive Collaborative Optimization (PACO)
algorithm to optimize Q-table initialization, providing better initial
estimates and accelerating learning. Second, we incorporate a
Utility-Controlled Heuristic (UCH) mechanism with dynamically tuned parameters
to optimize the reward function, enhancing the algorithm's accuracy and
effectiveness in path-planning tasks. Extensive experiments in three different
raster grid environments validate the superior performance of our IQL
framework. The results demonstrate that our IQL algorithm outperforms existing
methods, including FIQL, PP-QL-based CPP, DFQL, and QMABC algorithms, in terms
of path-planning capabilities.

reinforcement learning, addressing the challenge of deploying large world
models in resource-constrained environments. Our method distills a
high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact 1M parameter
model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MT30 benchmark with a
normalized score of 28.45, a substantial improvement over the original 1M
parameter model's score of 18.93. This demonstrates the ability of our
distillation technique to consolidate complex multi-task knowledge effectively.
Additionally, we apply FP16 post-training quantization, reducing the model size
by 50% while maintaining performance. Our work bridges the gap between the
power of large models and practical deployment constraints, offering a scalable
solution for efficient and accessible multi-task reinforcement learning in
robotics and other resource-limited domains.

                                        <span>  Legged robots have achieved impressive feats in dynamic locomotion in
challenging unstructured terrain. However, in entertainment applications, the
design and control of these robots face additional challenges in appealing to
human audiences. This work aims to unify expressive, artist-directed motions
and robust dynamic mobility for legged robots. To this end, we introduce a new
bipedal robot, designed with a focus on character-driven mechanical features.
We present a reinforcement learning-based control architecture to robustly
execute artistic motions conditioned on command signals. During runtime, these
command signals are generated by an animation engine which composes and blends
between multiple animation sources. Finally, an intuitive operator interface
enables real-time show performances with the robot. The complete system results
in a believable robotic character, and paves the way for enhanced human-robot
engagement in various contexts, in entertainment robotics and beyond.

                                        <span>  Manipulating deformable objects in robotic cells is often costly and not
widely accessible. However, the use of localized pneumatic gripping systems can
enhance accessibility. Current methods that use pneumatic grippers to handle
deformable objects struggle with effective lifting. This paper introduces a
method for the dexterous lifting of textile deformable objects from one edge,
utilizing a previously developed gripper designed for flexible and porous
materials. By precisely adjusting the orientation and position of the gripper
during the lifting process, we were able to significantly reduce necessary
gripping force and minimize object vibration caused by airflow. This method was
tested and validated on four materials with varying mass, friction, and
flexibility. The proposed approach facilitates the lifting of deformable
objects from a conveyor or automated line, even when only one edge is
accessible for grasping. Future work will involve integrating a vision system
to optimize the manipulation of deformable objects with more complex shapes.

                                        <span>  It has been shown recently that physics-based simulation significantly
enhances the disassembly capabilities of real-world assemblies with diverse 3D
shapes and stringent motion constraints. However, the efficiency suffers when
tackling intricate disassembly tasks that require numerous simulations and
increased simulation time. In this work, we propose a State-Based Disassembly
Planning (SBDP) approach, prioritizing physics-based simulation with
translational motion over rotational motion to facilitate autonomy, reducing
dependency on human input, while storing intermediate motion states to improve
search scalability. We introduce two novel evaluation functions derived from
new Directional Blocking Graphs (DBGs) enriched with state information to scale
up the search. Our experiments show that SBDP with new evaluation functions and
DBGs constraints outperforms the state-of-the-art in disassembly planning in
terms of success rate and computational efficiency over benchmark datasets
consisting of thousands of physically valid industrial assemblies.

end-effector or programming each joint. Whereas humans can control their own
arms easily by integrating visual and proprioceptive feedback, it is
challenging to control an external robot arm in the same way, due to its
inconsistent orientation and appearance. We explore teleoperating a robot arm
through motion-capture (MoCap) of the human operator's arm with the assistance
of augmented reality (AR) visualisations. We investigate how AR helps
teleoperation by visualising a virtual reference of the human arm alongside the
robot arm to help users understand the movement mapping. We found that the AR
overlay of a humanoid arm on the robot in the same orientation helped users
learn the control. We discuss findings and future work on MoCap-based robot
teleoperation.

                                        <span>  Depth estimation (DE) provides spatial information about a scene and enables
tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object detection, and scene understanding.
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using deep learning
(DL)-based methods for DE. Traditional techniques rely on handcrafted features
that often struggle to generalise to diverse scenes and require extensive
manual tuning. However, DL models for DE can automatically extract relevant
features from input data, adapt to various scene conditions, and generalise
well to unseen environments. Numerous DL-based methods have been developed,
making it necessary to survey and synthesize the state-of-the-art (SOTA).
Previous reviews on DE have mainly focused on either monocular or stereo-based
techniques, rather than comprehensively reviewing DE. Furthermore, to the best
of our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review (SLR) that
comprehensively focuses on DE. Therefore, this SLR study is being conducted.
Initially, electronic databases were searched for relevant publications,
resulting in 1284 publications. Using defined exclusion and quality criteria,
128 publications were shortlisted and further filtered to select 59
high-quality primary studies. These studies were analysed to extract data and
answer defined research questions. Based on the results, DL methods were
developed for mainly three different types of DE: monocular, stereo, and
multi-view. 20 publicly available datasets were used to train, test, and
evaluate DL models for DE, with KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and Make 3D being the most
used datasets. 29 evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of DE.
35 base models were reported in the primary studies, and the top five most-used
base models were ResNet-50, ResNet-18, ResNet-101, U-Net, and VGG-16. Finally,
the lack of ground truth data was among the most significant challenges
reported by primary studies.

office spaces. We introduce OfficeMate, a social OAR designed to assist with
practical tasks, foster social interaction, and promote health and well-being.
Through a pilot evaluation with seven participants in an office environment, we
found that users see potential in OARs for reducing stress and promoting
healthy habits and value the robot's ability to provide companionship and
physical activity reminders in the office space. However, concerns regarding
privacy, communication, and the robot's interaction timing were also raised.
The feedback highlights the need to carefully consider the robot's appearance

social norms. We believe these insights will better inform the development of
adaptive, intelligent OAR systems for future office space integration.

                                        <span>  Miniature underwater robots play a crucial role in the exploration and
development of marine resources, particularly in confined spaces and
high-pressure deep-sea environments. This study presents the design,
optimization, and performance of a miniature robotic fish, powered by the
oscillation of bio-inspired fins. These fins feature a rigid-flexible hybrid
structure and use an eccentric rotating mass (ERM) vibration motor as the
excitation source to generate high-frequency unidirectional oscillations that
induce acoustic streaming for propulsion. The drive mechanism, powered by
miniature ERM vibration motors, eliminates the need for complex mechanical
drive systems, enabling complete isolation of the entire drive system from the
external environment and facilitating the miniaturization of the robotic fish.
A compact, untethered robotic fish, measuring 85*60*45 mm^3, is equipped with
three bio-inspired fins located at the pectoral and caudal positions.
Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic fish achieves a maximum
forward swimming speed of 1.36 body lengths (BL) per second powered by all fins
and minimum turning radius of 0.6 BL when powered by a single fin. These
results underscore the significance of employing the ERM vibration motor in
advancing the development of highly maneuverable, miniature untethered
underwater robots for various marine exploration tasks.

Enhanced Quantile Regression Neural Networks EQRNNs, for anticipating system
failures in industrial robotics. We address the challenge of early failure
detection through a hybrid approach that combines advanced neural
architectures. The system leverages dual computational stages: first
implementing an EQRNN optimized for processing multi-sensor data streams
including vibration, thermal, and power signatures, followed by an integrated
Spiking Neural Network SNN, layer that enables microsecond-level response
times. This architecture achieves notable accuracy rates of 92.3\% in component
failure prediction with a 90-hour advance warning window. Field testing
conducted on an industrial scale with 50 robotic systems demonstrates
significant operational improvements, yielding a 94\% decrease in unexpected
system failures and 76\% reduction in maintenance-related downtimes. The
framework's effectiveness in processing complex, multi-modal sensor data while
maintaining computational efficiency validates its applicability for Industry
4.0 manufacturing environments.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) demonstrate the
significant potential in autonomous driving. Despite this promise, challenges
such as the manual design of reward functions and low sample efficiency in
complex environments continue to impede the development of safe and effective
driving policies. To tackle these issues, we introduce LearningFlow, an
innovative automated policy learning workflow tailored to urban driving. This
framework leverages the collaboration of multiple large language model (LLM)
agents throughout the RL training process. LearningFlow includes a curriculum
sequence generation process and a reward generation process, which work in
tandem to guide the RL policy by generating tailored training curricula and
reward functions. Particularly, each process is supported by an analysis agent
that evaluates training progress and provides critical insights to the
generation agent. Through the collaborative efforts of these LLM agents,
LearningFlow automates policy learning across a series of complex driving
tasks, and it significantly reduces the reliance on manual reward function
design while enhancing sample efficiency. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, along with comparisons with
other existing methods, to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that LearningFlow excels in generating rewards and
curricula. It also achieves superior performance and robust generalization
across various driving tasks, as well as commendable adaptation to different RL
algorithms.

(LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of
LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current
datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and
systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as
robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely
addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities
of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and
varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure
quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent
meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies.
Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that
ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we
conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific
LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of
LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for
embodied agents. All data and code are available at

                                        <span>  Continuous harvesting and storage of multiple fruits in a single operation
allow robots to significantly reduce the travel distance required for
repetitive back-and-forth movements. Traditional collision-free path planning
algorithms, such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and A-star (A), often
fail to meet the demands of efficient continuous fruit harvesting due to their
low search efficiency and the generation of excessive redundant points. This
paper presents the Interactive Local Minima Search Algorithm (ILMSA), a fast
path-planning method designed for the continuous harvesting of table-top grown
strawberries. The algorithm featured an interactive node expansion strategy
that iteratively extended and refined collision-free path segments based on
local minima points. To enable the algorithm to function in 3D, the 3D
environment was projected onto multiple 2D planes, generating optimal paths on
each plane. The best path was then selected, followed by integrating and
smoothing the 3D path segments. Simulations demonstrated that ILMSA
outperformed existing methods, reducing path length by 21.5% and planning time
by 97.1% compared to 3D-RRT, while achieving 11.6% shorter paths and 25.4%
fewer nodes than the Lowest Point of the Strawberry (LPS) algorithm in 3D
environments. In 2D, ILMSA achieved path lengths 16.2% shorter than A, 23.4%
shorter than RRT, and 20.9% shorter than RRT-Connect, while being over 96%
faster and generating significantly fewer nodes. Field tests confirmed ILMSA's
suitability for complex agricultural tasks, having a combined planning and
execution time and an average path length that were approximately 58% and 69%,
respectively, of those achieved by the LPS algorithm.

trade. To facilitate the development of autonomous vessels, high-fidelity
simulations are required to model realistic interactions with other vessels.
However, modeling realistic interactive maritime traffic is challenging due to
the unstructured environment, coarsely specified traffic rules, and largely
varying vessel types. Currently, there is no standard for simulating
interactive maritime environments in order to rigorously benchmark autonomous
vessel algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the first intelligent sailing
model (ISM), which simulates rule-compliant vessels for navigation on the open
sea. An ISM vessel reacts to other traffic participants according to maritime
traffic rules while at the same time solving a motion planning task
characterized by waypoints. In particular, the ISM monitors the applicable
rules, generates rule-compliant waypoints accordingly, and utilizes a model
predictive control for tracking the waypoints. We evaluate the ISM in two
environments: interactive traffic with only ISM vessels and mixed traffic where
some vessel trajectories are from recorded real-world maritime traffic data or
handcrafted for criticality. Our results show that simulations with many ISM
vessels of different vessel types are rule-compliant and scalable. We tested
4,049 critical traffic scenarios. For interactive traffic with ISM vessels, no
collisions occurred while goal-reaching rates of about 97 percent were
achieved. We believe that our ISM can serve as a standard for challenging and
realistic maritime traffic simulation to accelerate autonomous vessel
development.

                                        <span>  In autonomous driving, traditional Computer Vision (CV) agents often struggle
in unfamiliar situations due to biases in the training data. Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) agents address this by learning from experience and maximizing
rewards, which helps them adapt to dynamic environments. However, ensuring
their generalization remains challenging, especially with static training
environments. Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult
to guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during
training. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with
Curriculum Learning for autonomous driving. Our approach uses a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn safe
driving in the CARLA simulator. The agent is trained using two-fold curriculum
learning, progressively increasing environment difficulty and incorporating a
collision penalty in the reward function to promote safety. This method
improves the agent's adaptability and reliability in complex environments, and
understand the nuances of balancing multiple reward components from different
feedback signals in a single scalar reward function. Keywords: Computer Vision,

                                        <span>  As opposed to human drivers, current autonomous driving systems still require
vast amounts of labeled data to train. Recently, world models have been
proposed to simultaneously enhance autonomous driving capabilities by improving
the way these systems understand complex real-world environments and reduce
their data demands via self-supervised pre-training. In this paper, we present
AD-L-JEPA (aka Autonomous Driving with LiDAR data via a Joint Embedding
Predictive Architecture), a novel self-supervised pre-training framework for
autonomous driving with LiDAR data that, as opposed to existing methods, is
neither generative nor contrastive. Our method learns spatial world models with
a joint embedding predictive architecture. Instead of explicitly generating
masked unknown regions, our self-supervised world models predict Bird's Eye
View (BEV) embeddings to represent the diverse nature of autonomous driving
scenes. Our approach furthermore eliminates the need to manually create
positive and negative pairs, as is the case in contrastive learning. AD-L-JEPA
leads to simpler implementation and enhanced learned representations. We
qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate high-quality of embeddings learned
with AD-L-JEPA. We furthermore evaluate the accuracy and label efficiency of
AD-L-JEPA on popular downstream tasks such as LiDAR 3D object detection and
associated transfer learning. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that
AD-L-JEPA is a plausible approach for self-supervised pre-training in
autonomous driving applications and is the best available approach
outperforming SOTA, including most recently proposed Occupancy-MAE [1] and ALSO
[2]. The source code of AD-L-JEPA is available at

interaction (HRI) in the wild. To explore this, we conducted a field study by
deploying a fully autonomous conversational robot in a shopping mall over two
days. Through sequential video analysis, we identified five patterns of
interaction fluency (Smooth, Awkward, Active, Messy, and Quiet), four types of
user motivation for interacting with the robot (Function, Experiment,
Curiosity, and Education), and user positioning towards the robot. We further
analyzed how these motivations and positioning influence interaction fluency.
Our findings suggest that incorporating users' motivation types into the design
of robot behavior can enhance interaction fluency, engagement, and user
satisfaction in real-world HRI scenarios.

                                        <span>  The Orienteering Problem (OP) is a well-studied routing problem that has been
extended to incorporate uncertainties, reflecting stochastic or dynamic travel
costs, prize-collection costs, and prizes. Existing approaches may, however, be
inefficient in real-world applications due to insufficient modeling knowledge
and initially unknowable parameters in online scenarios. Thus, we propose the
Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem (UDOP), modeling travel costs as
distributions with unknown and time-variant parameters. UDOP also associates
uncertain travel costs with dynamic prizes and prize-collection costs for its
objective and budget constraints. To address UDOP, we develop an ADaptive
Approach for Probabilistic paThs - ADAPT, that iteratively performs 'execution'
and 'online planning' based on an initial 'offline' solution. The execution
phase updates system status and records online cost observations. The online
planner employs a Bayesian approach to adaptively estimate power consumption
and optimize path sequence based on safety beliefs. We evaluate ADAPT in a
practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) charging scheduling problem for
Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. The UAV must optimize its path to
recharge sensor nodes efficiently while managing its energy under uncertain
conditions. ADAPT maintains comparable solution quality and computation time
while offering superior robustness. Extensive simulations show that ADAPT
achieves a 100% Mission Success Rate (MSR) across all tested scenarios,
outperforming comparable heuristic-based and frequentist approaches that fail
up to 70% (under challenging conditions) and averaging 67% MSR, respectively.
This work advances the field of OP with uncertainties, offering a reliable and
efficient approach for real-world applications in uncertain and dynamic
environments.

of moving obstacles. Although the scenario map is known, the robot lacks
information about the movement of dynamic obstacles during the monitoring
mission. Numerous local planners have been developed in recent years for
navigating highly dynamic environments. However, the absence of a global
planner for these environments can result in unavoidable collisions or the
inability to successfully complete missions in densely populated areas, such as
a scenario monitoring in our case. This work addresses the development and
evaluation of a global planner, $MADA$ (Monitoring Avoiding Dynamic Areas),
aimed at enhancing the deployment of robots in such challenging conditions. The
robot plans and executes the mission using the proposed two-step approach. The
first step involves selecting the observation goal based on the environment's
distribution and estimated monitoring costs. In the second step, the robot
identifies areas with moving obstacles and obtains paths avoiding densely
occupied dynamic regions based on their occupation. Quantitative and
qualitative results based on simulations and on real-world experimentation,
confirm that the proposed method allows the robot to effectively monitor most
of the environment while avoiding densely occupied dynamic areas.

measurements with inertial navigation systems (INS) and global navigation
satellite systems (GNSS). Telemetry-based applications typically source speed
data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of
deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed,
differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error
characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy
applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse
speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and
alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of
autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving
(AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of
speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its
error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data
from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in
Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role
of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed
estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly
in GNSS-denied environments.

                                        <span>  Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a critical component of logistics and
warehouse management, which focuses on planning collision-free paths for a team
of robots in a known environment. Recent work introduced a novel MAPF approach,
LNS2, which proposed to repair a quickly obtained set of infeasible paths via
iterative replanning, by relying on a fast, yet lower-quality, prioritized
planning (PP) algorithm. At the same time, there has been a recent push for
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based MAPF algorithms, which exhibit
improved cooperation over such PP algorithms, although inevitably remaining
slower. In this paper, we introduce a new MAPF algorithm, LNS2+RL, which
combines the distinct yet complementary characteristics of LNS2 and MARL to
effectively balance their individual limitations and get the best from both
worlds. During early iterations, LNS2+RL relies on MARL for low-level
replanning, which we show eliminates collisions much more than a PP algorithm.
There, our MARL-based planner allows agents to reason about past and future
information to gradually learn cooperative decision-making through a finely
designed curriculum learning. At later stages of planning, LNS2+RL adaptively
switches to PP algorithm to quickly resolve the remaining collisions, naturally
trading off solution quality (number of collisions in the solution) and
computational efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on high-agent-density
tasks across various team sizes, world sizes, and map structures consistently
demonstrate the superior performance of LNS2+RL compared to many MAPF
algorithms, including LNS2, LaCAM, EECBS, and SCRIMP. In maps with complex
structures, the advantages of LNS2+RL are particularly pronounced, with LNS2+RL
achieving a success rate of over 50% in nearly half of the tested tasks, while
that of LaCAM, EECBS and SCRIMP falls to 0%.

                                        <span>  The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is a crucial component of
LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. However, its performance can be negatively
affected in unstructured environments that lack features and geometric
structures, leading to low accuracy and poor robustness in localization and
mapping. It is known that degeneracy caused by the lack of geometric
constraints can lead to errors in 6-DOF pose estimation along ill-conditioned
directions. Therefore, there is a need for a broader and more fine-grained
degeneracy detection and handling method. This paper proposes a new point cloud
registration framework, LP-ICP, that combines point-to-line and point-to-plane
distance metrics in the ICP algorithm, with localizability detection and
handling. LP-ICP consists of a localizability detection module and an
optimization module. The localizability detection module performs
localizability analysis by utilizing the correspondences between edge points
(with low local smoothness) to lines and planar points (with high local
smoothness) to planes between the scan and the map. The localizability
contribution of individual correspondence constraints can be applied to a
broader range. The optimization module adds additional soft and hard
constraints to the optimization equations based on the localizability category.
This allows the pose to be constrained along ill-conditioned directions, with
updates either tending towards the constraint value or leaving the initial
estimate unchanged. This improves accuracy and reduces fluctuations. The
proposed method is extensively evaluated through experiments on both simulation
and real-world datasets, demonstrating higher or comparable accuracy than the
state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and code of this paper will also be
open-sourced at https://github.com/xuqingyuan2000/LP-ICP.

multiple safeguards to mitigate the risk of collision between drones flying in
close-proximity scenarios. Cooperative navigation and flight coordination
strategies that rely on pre-planned trajectories, constant %{satellite and
network connectivity and reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
positioning are brittle to failure. Drone embedded sense and detect offers a
comprehensive mode of separation between drones for deconfliction and collision
avoidance. This paper presents the first airborne LiDAR based solution for
drone-swarm detection and localization using 3D deep learning model. It adapts
an existing deep learning neural network to the air-to-air drone scenario by
expanding the scan space vertically. A new sparse convolution is proposed and
applied to accelerate the backbone layer, which is the most time-consuming part
of the neural network. To collect training data of safety critical,
close-proximity multi-drone operations, a scenario Digital Twin is used to
augment real datasets with high fidelity synthetic data. The trained model
achieves over 80% recall and 96% precision when tested on real-world datasets.
By incorporating a tracking-by-detection algorithm the system can reliably
monitor the separation distance of multiple drones in challenging environments.

                                        <span>  Despite decades of research and development, myoelectric prosthetic hands
lack functionality and are often rejected by users. This lack in functionality
can be partially attributed to the widely accepted anthropomorphic design
ideology in the field; attempting to replicate human hand form and function
despite severe limitations in control and sensing technology. Instead,
prosthetic hands can be tailored to perform specific tasks without increasing
complexity by shedding the constraints of anthropomorphism. In this paper, we
develop and evaluate four open-source modular non-humanoid devices to perform
the motion required to replicate human flicking motion and to twist a
screwdriver, and the functionality required to pick and place flat objects and
to cut paper. Experimental results from these devices demonstrate that, versus
a humanoid prosthesis, non-humanoid prosthesis design dramatically improves
task performance, reduces user compensatory movement, and reduces task load.
Case studies with two end users demonstrate the translational benefits of this
research. We found that special attention should be paid to monitoring end-user
task load to ensure positive rehabilitation outcomes.

a cornerstone of Industry 4.0. AI's role in enhancing robotic manipulators -
key drivers in the Fourth Industrial Revolution - is rapidly leading to
significant innovations in smart manufacturing. The objective of this article
is to frame these innovations in practical force-controlled applications - e.g.
deburring, polishing, and assembly tasks like peg-in-hole (PiH) - highlighting
their necessity for maintaining high-quality production standards. By reporting
on recent AI-based methodologies, this article contrasts them and identifies
current challenges to be addressed in future research. The analysis concludes
with a perspective on future research directions, emphasizing the need for
common performance metrics to validate AI techniques, integration of various
enhancements for performance optimization, and the importance of validating
them in relevant scenarios. These future directions aim to provide consistency
with already adopted approaches, so as to be compatible with manufacturing
standards, increasing the relevance of AI-driven methods in both academic and
industrial contexts.

semantic information for navigating in unseen environments. These VSN models
are typically tested in those virtual environments where they are trained,
mainly using reinforcement learning based approaches. Therefore, we do not yet
have an in-depth analysis of how these models would behave in the real world.
In this work, we propose a new solution to integrate VSN models into real
robots, so that we have true embodied agents. We also release a novel ROS-based
framework for VSN, ROS4VSN, so that any VSN-model can be easily deployed in any
ROS-compatible robot and tested in a real setting. Our experiments with two
different robots, where we have embedded two state-of-the-art VSN agents,
confirm that there is a noticeable performance difference of these VSN
solutions when tested in real-world and simulation environments. We hope that
this research will endeavor to provide a foundation for addressing this
consequential issue, with the ultimate aim of advancing the performance and
efficiency of embodied agents within authentic real-world scenarios. Code to

with mobility impairments. While the current challenges focus on
human-compliant hardware and control, unlocking their use for daily activities
requires a scene perception system. In this work, we present Exosense, a
vision-centric scene understanding system for self-balancing exoskeletons. We
introduce a multi-sensor visual-inertial mapping device as well as a navigation
stack for state estimation, terrain mapping and long-term operation. We tested
Exosense attached to both a human leg and Wandercraft's Personal Exoskeleton in
real-world indoor scenarios. This enabled us to test the system during typical
periodic walking gaits, as well as future uses in multi-story environments. We
demonstrate that Exosense can achieve an odometry drift of about 4 cm per meter
traveled, and construct terrain maps under 1 cm average reconstruction error.
It can also work in a visual localization mode in a previously mapped
environment, providing a step towards long-term operation of exoskeletons.

                                        <span>  Various adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to autonomous
driving (AD) street scene semantic understanding (segmentation). A common
strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and
adverse weather conditions. However, this technique typically relies on
utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in
practice. Furthermore, this method typically targets a single adverse
condition, and thus perform poorly when confronting a mixture of multiple
adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a
reference-free and Adverse weather-Immune scheme (called AdvImmu) that
leverages the invariance of weather conditions over short periods (seconds).
Specifically, AdvImmu includes three components: Locally Sequential Mechanism
(LSM), Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM), and Unfolded Regularizers (URs). LSM
leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to enhance model
performance. GSM is proposed to shuffle LSM segments to prevent overfitting of
temporal patterns. URs are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed
regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather
generalization. In addition, to overcome the over-reliance on consecutive
frame-wise annotations in the training of AdvImmu (typically unavailable in AD
scenarios), we incorporate a foundation model named Segment Anything Model
(SAM) to assist to annotate frames, and additionally propose a cluster
algorithm (denoted as SBICAC) to surmount SAM's category-agnostic issue to
generate pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
AdvImmu outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 88.56% in mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU).

to improve efficiency by reducing congestion and optimizing traffic flow
systematically. In this paper, we introduce CoMAL (Collaborative Multi-Agent
LLMs), a framework designed to address the mixed-autonomy traffic problem by
collaboration among autonomous vehicles to optimize traffic flow. CoMAL is
built upon large language models, operating in an interactive traffic
simulation environment. It utilizes a Perception Module to observe surrounding
agents and a Memory Module to store strategies for each agent. The overall
workflow includes a Collaboration Module that encourages autonomous vehicles to
discuss the effective strategy and allocate roles, a reasoning engine to
determine optimal behaviors based on assigned roles, and an Execution Module
that controls vehicle actions using a hybrid approach combining rule-based
models. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAL achieves superior
performance on the Flow benchmark. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of
different language models and compare our framework with reinforcement learning
approaches. It highlights the strong cooperative capability of LLM agents and
presents a promising solution to the mixed-autonomy traffic challenge. The code

                                        <span>  Real-world legged locomotion systems often need to reconcile agility and
safety for different scenarios. Moreover, the underlying dynamics are often
unknown and time-variant (e.g., payload, friction). In this paper, we introduce
BAS (Bridging Adaptivity and Safety), which builds upon the pipeline of prior
work Agile But Safe (ABS)(He et al.) and is designed to provide adaptive safety
even in dynamic environments with uncertainties. BAS involves an agile policy
to avoid obstacles rapidly and a recovery policy to prevent collisions, a
physical parameter estimator that is concurrently trained with agile policy,
and a learned control-theoretic RA (reach-avoid) value network that governs the
policy switch. Also, the agile policy and RA network are both conditioned on
physical parameters to make them adaptive. To mitigate the distribution shift
issue, we further introduce an on-policy fine-tuning phase for the estimator to
enhance its robustness and accuracy. The simulation results show that BAS
achieves 50% better safety than baselines in dynamic environments while
maintaining a higher speed on average. In real-world experiments, BAS shows its
capability in complex environments with unknown physics (e.g., slippery floors
with unknown frictions, unknown payloads up to 8kg), while baselines lack
adaptivity, leading to collisions or. degraded agility. As a result, BAS
achieves a 19.8% increase in speed and gets a 2.36 times lower collision rate
than ABS in the real world. Videos: https://adaptive-safe-locomotion.github.io.

                                        <span>  Building 3D geometric maps of man-made spaces is a well-established and
active field that is fundamental to computer vision and robotics. However,
considering the evolving nature of built environments, it is essential to
question the capabilities of current mapping efforts in handling temporal
changes. In addition, spatiotemporal mapping holds significant potential for
achieving sustainability and circularity goals. Existing mapping approaches
focus on small changes, such as object relocation or self-driving car
operation; in all cases where the main structure of the scene remains fixed.
Consequently, these approaches fail to address more radical changes in the
structure of the built environment, such as geometry and topology. To this end,
we introduce the Nothing Stands Still (NSS) benchmark, which focuses on the
spatiotemporal registration of 3D scenes undergoing large spatial and temporal
change, ultimately creating one coherent spatiotemporal map. Specifically, the
benchmark involves registering two or more partial 3D point clouds (fragments)
from the same scene but captured from different spatiotemporal views. In
addition to the standard pairwise registration, we assess the multi-way
registration of multiple fragments that belong to any temporal stage. As part
of NSS, we introduce a dataset of 3D point clouds recurrently captured in
large-scale building indoor environments that are under construction or
renovation. The NSS benchmark presents three scenarios of increasing
difficulty, to quantify the generalization ability of point cloud registration
methods over space (within one building and across buildings) and time. We
conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art methods on NSS. The results
demonstrate the necessity for novel methods specifically designed to handle
large spatiotemporal changes. The homepage of our benchmark is at

vision-based human-to-mobile-robot (H2MR) handover skills. Unlike traditional
fixed-base handovers, this task requires a mobile robot to reliably receive
objects in a large workspace enabled by its mobility. Our key insight is that
generalizable handover skills can be developed in simulators using high-quality
synthetic data, without the need for real-world demonstrations. To achieve
this, we propose a scalable pipeline for generating diverse synthetic full-body
human motion data, an automated method for creating safe and imitation-friendly
demonstrations, and an efficient 4D imitation learning method for distilling
large-scale demonstrations into closed-loop policies with base-arm
coordination. Experimental evaluations in both simulators and the real world
show significant improvements (at least +15% success rate) over baseline
methods in all cases. Experiments also validate that large-scale and diverse
synthetic data greatly enhances robot learning, highlighting our scalable
framework.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning has become an essential algorithm for generating
complex robotic behaviors. However, to learn such behaviors, it is necessary to
design a reward function that describes the task, which often consists of
multiple objectives that needs to be balanced. This tuning process is known as
reward engineering and typically involves extensive trial-and-error. In this
paper, to avoid this trial-and-error process, we propose the concept of
Constraints as Rewards (CaR). CaR formulates the task objective using multiple
constraint functions instead of a reward function and solves a reinforcement
learning problem with constraints using the Lagrangian-method. By adopting this
approach, different objectives are automatically balanced, because Lagrange
multipliers serves as the weights among the objectives. In addition, we will
demonstrate that constraints, expressed as inequalities, provide an intuitive
interpretation of the optimization target designed for the task. We apply the
proposed method to the standing-up motion generation task of a
six-wheeled-telescopic-legged robot and demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully acquires the target behavior, even though it is challenging to
learn with manually designed reward functions.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for
suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization.
Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine,
thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design
purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles
attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the
altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal
(downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the
non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov
stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the
inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output
tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference
tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The
zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the
outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral
action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In
the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty
is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known
aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is
proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a
single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference
vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to
verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to
track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances.
Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission
scenarios is minimal to none.

improve the transparency and understanding of predictive models in control of
automated supply air temperature (ASAT) of Air Handling Unit (AHU). The study
focuses on forecasting of ASAT using a linear regression with Huber loss.
However, having only a control curve without semantic and/or physical
explanation is often not enough. The present study employs one of the XAI
methods: Shapley values, which allows to reveal the reasoning and highlight the
contribution of each feature to the final ASAT forecast. In comparison to other
XAI methods, Shapley values have solid mathematical background, resulting in
interpretation transparency. The study demonstrates the contrastive
explanations--slices, for each control value of ASAT, which makes it possible
to give the client objective justifications for curve changes.

morphing aircraft (MA) is studied by using meta-learning (ML) and coupled
state-dependent Riccati equations (CSDREs). Our method is built on two
principal observations that dynamic models of MA under varying morphing
conditions share a morphing condition independent representation function and
that the specific morphing condition part lies in a set of linear coefficients.
To that end, the domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML) is
employed to learn the shared representation with offline flight data. Based on
the learned representation function, the coordinated control of the deformation
and flight for MA is formulated as a non-cooperative differential game. The
state-dependent feedback control solutions can be derived by addressing a pair
of CSDREs. For this purpose, Lyapunov iterations are extended to obtain the
positive semidefinite (definite) stabilizing solutions of the CSDREs, and the
convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is provided. Finally, a simulation
study is carried out to validate the efficacy of the developed coordinated game
control strategies.

                                        <span>  Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household
electricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the
household electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for
saving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy
Storage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage
in SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take
additional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices,
which happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not
possess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to
participate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does
not require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain
existing energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation
of SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction
step during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the
energy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal
services (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more
electricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a
matching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption
behaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients
in DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the
matching mechanism.

normality of the multiple parameter maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) from
censored data, where the censoring mechanism is in the form of $1$-bit
measurements. The underlying distribution of the uncensored data is assumed to
belong to the exponential family, with natural parameters expressed as a linear
combination of the predictors, known as generalized linear model (GLM). As part
of the analysis, the Fisher information matrix is also derived for both
censored and uncensored data, which helps to quantify the impact of censoring
and assess the performance of the MLE. The choice of GLM allows one to consider
a variety of practical examples where 1-bit estimation is of interest. In
particular, it is shown how the derived results can be used to analyze two
practically relevant scenarios: the Gaussian model with both unknown mean and
variance, and the Poisson model with an unknown mean.

                                        <span>  The Orienteering Problem (OP) is a well-studied routing problem that has been
extended to incorporate uncertainties, reflecting stochastic or dynamic travel
costs, prize-collection costs, and prizes. Existing approaches may, however, be
inefficient in real-world applications due to insufficient modeling knowledge
and initially unknowable parameters in online scenarios. Thus, we propose the
Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem (UDOP), modeling travel costs as
distributions with unknown and time-variant parameters. UDOP also associates
uncertain travel costs with dynamic prizes and prize-collection costs for its
objective and budget constraints. To address UDOP, we develop an ADaptive
Approach for Probabilistic paThs - ADAPT, that iteratively performs 'execution'
and 'online planning' based on an initial 'offline' solution. The execution
phase updates system status and records online cost observations. The online
planner employs a Bayesian approach to adaptively estimate power consumption
and optimize path sequence based on safety beliefs. We evaluate ADAPT in a
practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) charging scheduling problem for
Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. The UAV must optimize its path to
recharge sensor nodes efficiently while managing its energy under uncertain
conditions. ADAPT maintains comparable solution quality and computation time
while offering superior robustness. Extensive simulations show that ADAPT
achieves a 100% Mission Success Rate (MSR) across all tested scenarios,
outperforming comparable heuristic-based and frequentist approaches that fail
up to 70% (under challenging conditions) and averaging 67% MSR, respectively.
This work advances the field of OP with uncertainties, offering a reliable and
efficient approach for real-world applications in uncertain and dynamic
environments.

                                        <span>  We first propose systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for
linear time-invariant systems, under standard assumptions involving
observability and interval bounds on the initial condition and disturbances.
Historically, such designs rely on transformations with certain limitations
into a form that is Metzler (for continuous time) or non-negative (for discrete
time). We show that they can be effectively replaced with a linear
time-invariant transformation that can be easily computed offline. Next, we
propose an extension to the time-varying setting, addressing the limitations of
conventional transformations that lack guaranteed outcomes. We employ dynamical
transformations into higher-dimensional target forms for which an interval
observer can always be constructed. These transformations become
left-invertible after a certain time, provided observability conditions are met
and the target dynamics are sufficiently high-dimensional and fast, thus
enabling the reconstruction of bounds in the original coordinates in finite
time. Academic examples are presented to illustrate our methods.

                                        <span>  Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting
intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are
analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms
from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1)
prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2)
that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a
reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For
online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the
regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost)
over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the
single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant
difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions
made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about
the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a
fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature
results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori
assuming that all time varying parameters are bounded, which for many
optimization tasks is not unrealistic, but is a non starter in control
applications. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the
regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control
based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion
about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control and ask the
following question "Are regret optimal control strategies deployable?"

                                        <span>  This article presents a formalism inspired by Dennett's notion of the
intentional stance. Whereas Dennett's treatment of these concepts is informal,
we aim to provide a more formal analogue. We introduce a framework based on
stochastic processes with inputs and outputs, in which we can talk precisely
about *interpreting* systems as having *normative-epistemic states*, which
combine belief-like and desire-like features. Our framework is based on
optimality but nevertheless allows us to model some forms of bounded cognition.
  One might expect that the systems that can be described in
normative-epistemic terms would be some special subset of all systems, but we
show that this is not the case: every system admits a (possibly trivial)
normative-epistemic interpretation, and those that can be *uniquely specified*
by a normative-epistemic description are exactly the deterministic ones.
Finally, we show that there is a suitable notion of Bayesian updating for
normative-epistemic states, which we call *value-laden filtering*, since it
involves both normative and epistemic elements. For unbounded cognition it is
always permissible to attribute beliefs that update in this way. This is not
always the case for bounded cognition, but we give a sufficient condition under
which it is.
  This paper gives an overview of our framework aimed at cognitive scientists,
with a formal mathematical treatment given in a companion paper.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a novel control framework to address the satisfaction
of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain high-order MIMO
nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the
constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled
time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities.
First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down
to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed
distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To
achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when
satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying
output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust
and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction
of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for
online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating
solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time.
Finally, simulation examples of trajectory and region tracking for a mobile
robot validate the proposed approach.

perturbations of atmospheric states to realize specified changes in subsequent
weather. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to
find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled
variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method
first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as
accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as
temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using a numerical
weather prediction (NWP) model. Then a convex optimization problem is
formulated to achieve various control specifications involving not only
quadratic functions but also absolute values and maximum values of the
controlled variables and initial atmospheric variables in the cost function and
constraints. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble
experiment using the NWP model. The experiments showed that the identified
perturbations successfully realized specified spatial distributions of
accumulated precipitation.

                                        <span>  Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or
electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple
consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce
their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving.
In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens
of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of
strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game
structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave,
quasiconcave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the
extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period
setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition
and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the
stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing
equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the
peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized
peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of
quasiconcave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in
the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers' flexibility and
inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the
influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical
simulations to validate our theoretical results.

                                        <span>  Multi-agent systems are increasingly applied in space missions, including
distributed space systems, resilient constellations, and autonomous rendezvous
and docking operations. A critical emerging application is collaborative
spacecraft servicing, which encompasses on-orbit maintenance, space debris
removal, and swarm-based satellite repositioning. These missions involve
servicing spacecraft interacting with malfunctioning or defunct spacecraft
under challenging conditions, such as limited state information, measurement
inaccuracies, and erratic target behaviors. Existing approaches often rely on
assumptions of full state knowledge or single-integrator dynamics, which are
impractical for real-world applications involving second-order spacecraft
dynamics. This work addresses these challenges by developing a distributed
state estimation and tracking framework that requires only relative position
measurements and operates under partial state information. A novel
$\rho$-filter is introduced to reconstruct unknown states using locally
available information, and a Lyapunov-based deep neural network adaptive
controller is developed that adaptively compensates for uncertainties stemming
from unknown spacecraft dynamics. To ensure the collaborative spacecraft
regulation problem is well-posed, a trackability condition is defined. A
Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to ensure exponential convergence
of errors in state estimation and spacecraft regulation to a neighborhood of
the origin under the trackability condition. The developed method eliminates
the need for expensive velocity sensors or extensive pre-training, offering a
practical and robust solution for spacecraft servicing in complex, dynamic
environments.

                                        <span>  Faults on power lines and other electric equipment are known to cause
wildfire ignitions. To mitigate the threat of wildfire ignitions from electric
power infrastructure, many utilities preemptively de-energize power lines,
which may result in power shutoffs. Data regarding wildfire ignition risks are
key inputs for effective planning of power line de-energizations. However,
there are multiple ways to formulate risk metrics that spatially aggregate
wildfire risk map data, and there are different ways of leveraging this data to
make decisions. The key contribution of this paper is to define and compare the
results of employing six metrics for quantifying the wildfire ignition risks of
power lines from risk maps, considering both threshold- and optimization-based
methods for planning power line de-energizations. The numeric results use the
California Test System (CATS), a large-scale synthetic grid model with power
line corridors accurately representing California infrastructure, in
combination with real Wildland Fire Potential Index data for a full year. This
is the first application of optimal power shutoff planning on such a large and
realistic test case. Our results show that the choice of risk metric
significantly impacts the lines that are de-energized and the resulting load
shed. We find that the optimization-based method results in significantly less
load shed than the threshold-based method while achieving the same risk
reduction.

mixed-integer programs with finite uncertainty sets. Our method combines and
extends speed-up techniques used in previous scenario addition methods (also
called column-and-constraint generation methods) and introduces several new
techniques. In particular, it uses dual bounds for second-stage problems in
order to allow a faster identification of the next promising scenario to be
added to the master problem. Moreover, adaptive time limits are imposed to
avoid getting stuck on particularly hard second-stage problems, and a gap
propagation between master problem and second-stage problems is used to stop
solving them earlier if only a given non-zero optimality gap is to be reached
overall. This makes our method particularly effective for problems where
solving the second-stage problem is computationally challenging. To evaluate
the method's performance, we compare it to two recent scenario addition methods
from the literature on two applications: a robust capacitated location routing
problem and a robust integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment and
scheduling problem. The first problem features a particularly hard second
stage, and we show that our method is able to solve considerably more and
larger instances in a given time limit. Using the second problem, we verify the
general applicability of our method, even for problems where the second stage
is relatively easy.

shapes that closely resemble an honeycomb cluster, that is, a tessellation of
the plane by regular hexagons. Although these shapes are not always the direct
product of energy minimization, they can still be understood, at least
phenomenologically, as low-energy configurations. In this paper, explicit
quantitative estimates on the geometry of such low-energy configurations are
provided, showing in particular that the vast majority of the chambers must be

in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies
applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation
dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two
prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the
dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The
emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR
compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and
contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this
approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in
scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.

establish an analogue of the renowned Faber-Krahn inequality for the fractional
composite membrane problem. Next, we investigate an isoperimetric inequality
for the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem on the
intersection of two domains-a problem that was first studied by Lieb [23] for
the Laplacian. Similar results in the local case were previously obtained by
Cupini-Vecchi [9] for the composite membrane problem. Our findings provide
further insights into the fractional setting, offering a new perspective on
these classical inequalities.

socio-political feasibility of energy transitions. Participatory research in
energy modelling offers the opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a
comprehensive way, but is limited by how results can be generated and presented
without imposing assumptions and discrete scenarios on the participants. To
this end, we present a methodology and a framework, based on near-optimal
modelling results, that can incorporate stakeholders in a holistic and engaging
way. We confront stakeholders with a continuum of modelling-based energy system
designs via an interactive interface allowing them to choose essentially any
combination of components that meet the system requirements. Together with
information on the implications of different technologies, it is possible to
assess how participants prioritise different aspects in energy systems planning
while also facilitating learning in an engaging and stimulating way. We
showcase the methodology for the remote Arctic settlement of Longyearbyen and
illustrate how participants deviate consistently from the cost optimum. At the
same time, they manage to balance different priorities such as emissions,
costs, and system vulnerability leading to a better understanding of the
complexity and intertwined nature of decisions.

controlled open quantum systems within the framework of bilinear dynamical
systems. We define the corresponding notions of identifiability from the
results of quantum state tomography, obtained in many copies of the initial
quantum state, under subsequences of varying lengths of control signals. We
explain and extend work on identifiability of bilinear systems using either
spectral criteria, criteria based on Hankel matrix, and frequency-domain
criteria, to the parameter estimation of master equations of open quantum
systems. This sets the groundwork for a number of constructive approaches to
the identification of open quantum systems.

                                        <span>  Problem definition: Drones, despite being acknowledged as a transformative
force in the city logistics sector, are unable to execute the
\textit{last-meter delivery} (unloading goods directly to customers' doorsteps)
due to airspace restrictions and safety concerns. To leverage advancements and
overcome the limitations of drones in providing intra-city express services, we
introduce a coordinated drone-courier logistics system where drones operate
within a closed network among vertiports, while couriers connect customers to
the drone delivery system. This paper aims to shed light on this coordinated
system in terms of system feasibility, network interactivity, and long-term
sustainability. Methodology/Results: We develop an integrated optimization
model to optimize the network planning of the coordinated logistics system. The
interplay between network planning and tactical operations is mirrored by a
queueing network model, resulting in the nonlinear and nonconvex (partially
convex and partially concave) feasible region of the optimization model. An
iterative exact algorithm that tightens lower and upper bounds by adaptively
refining the linear approximations of nonlinear constraints is developed to
provide optimality-guaranteed solutions with finite convergence. The
computational experiments demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our
algorithm across various network configurations and scenarios.Managerial
implications: The case study, based on a real-world dataset from SF Express, a
logistics giant in China, validates that the coordinated logistics system
efficiently attains cost and time savings by leveraging the effective turnover
of drones and the coordination between drones and couriers. The optimal network
design features a concentrated structure, streamlining demand consolidation and
reducing deadhead repositioning.

                                        <span>  We present a novel passivity enforcement (passivation) method, called KLAP,
for linear time-invariant systems based on the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP)
lemma and the closely related Lur'e equations. The passivation problem in our
framework corresponds to finding a perturbation to a given non-passive system
that renders the system passive while minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_2$ or
frequency-weighted $\mathcal{H}_2$ distance between the original non-passive
and the resulting passive system. We show that this problem can be formulated
as an unconstrained optimization problem whose objective function can be
differentiated efficiently even in large-scale settings. We show that any
minimizer of the unconstrained problem yields the same passive system.
Furthermore, we prove that, in the absence of a feedthrough term, every local
minimizer is also a global minimizer. For cases involving a non-trivial
feedthrough term, we analyze global minimizers in relation to the extremal
solutions of the Lur'e equations, which can serve as tools for identifying
local minima. To solve the resulting numerical optimization problem
efficiently, we propose an initialization strategy based on modifying the
feedthrough term and a restart strategy when it is likely that the optimization
has converged to a local minimum. Numerical examples illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

formulation for systems with discrete control inputs under dwell time
constraints. By viewing such systems as a switched system, the problem is
decomposed into a Sequence Optimization (SO) and a Switching Time Optimization
(STO) -- the former providing the sequence of the switched system, and the
latter calculating the optimal switching times. By limiting the feasible set of
SO to subsequences of a master sequence, this formulation requires a small
number of binary variables, independent of the number of time discretization
nodes. This enables the proposed formulation to provide solutions efficiently,
even for large numbers of time discretization nodes. To provide even faster
solutions, an iterative algorithm is introduced to heuristically solve STO and
SO. The proposed approaches are then showcased on four different switched
systems and results demonstrate the efficiency of the MINLP formulation and the
iterative algorithm.

                                        <span>  Binary Quadratic Programs (BQPs) are a class of NP-hard problems that arise
in a wide range of applications, including finance, machine learning, and
logistics. These problems are challenging to solve due to the combinatorial
search space and nonlinearity. In fact, this class of optimization problems is
so challenging that, in many instances, standard algorithms struggle to
identify feasible solutions within a reasonable time. Primal heuristic
algorithms have been developed to quickly identify feasible solutions to BQPs.
In this paper, we propose Cover-Relax-Search, an efficient primal heuristic for
BQPs. This approach is inspired by multiple local search algorithms, including
Undercover. We evaluate the \emph{Cover-Relax-Search} algorithm on multiple BQP
benchmarks and show that our proposed heuristic identifies high-quality
solutions at a faster speed and significantly reduces the primal integral
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and other local search baselines.

                                        <span>  Quantum computing provides a novel approach to addressing conventionally
intractable issues in large-scale optimization. Space logistics missions
require the efficient routing of payloads, spacecraft, and resources across
complex networks, often resulting in an exponential growth of the solution
space that classical methods cannot efficiently solve. This paper leverages
entropy quantum computing to model and solve the space logistics problem as a
time-dependent multicommodity network flow, enabling the exploration of large
solution spaces. The findings highlight quantum computing's potential to
address complex aerospace logistics, demonstrating its suitability for complex
interplanetary mission planning.

algorithm is novel, and not a minor twist on an existing method? In this paper,
we present a framework for reasoning about equivalence between a broad class of
iterative algorithms, with a focus on algorithms designed for convex
optimization. We propose several notions of what it means for two algorithms to
be equivalent, and provide computationally tractable means to detect
equivalence. Our main definition, oracle equivalence, states that two
algorithms are equivalent if they result in the same sequence of calls to the
function oracles (for suitable initialization). Borrowing from control theory,
we use state-space realizations to represent algorithms and characterize
algorithm equivalence via transfer functions. Our framework can also identify
and characterize equivalence between algorithms that use different oracles that
are related via a linear fractional transformation. Prominent examples include
linear transformations and function conjugation.

quasi (parametric) variational inequalities in which the convex set in the
classical variational inequality also depends upon the solution explicitly or
implicitly. We study the stability of a continuous method of a gradient type.
Some iterative implicit and explicit schemes are suggested as counterparts of
the continuous case by inertial proximal methods. The convergence analysis of
these proposed methods is established under sufficient mild conditions.
Moreover, some applications dealing with the generalized Nash equilibrium
problems are presented.

distribution without explicitly learning an operator that governs the
evolution. A particular application of interest is discrete measures $\mu_t^N$
that arise from systems of $N$ particles in $\mathbb R^d$. In many such
situations, the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales,
making it difficult to learn the dynamics of a governing operator, but the bulk
distribution $\mu_t^N$ approximates an absolutely continuous measure $\mu_t$
that evolves ``smoothly.'' If $\mu_t$ is known on some time interval, then
linearized optimal transport theory provides an Euler-like scheme for
approximating the evolution of $\mu_t$ using its ``tangent vector field''
(represented as a time-dependent vector field on $\mathbb R^d$), which can be
computed as a limit of optimal transport maps. We propose an analog of this
Euler approximation to predict the evolution of the discrete measure $\mu_t^N$
(without knowing $\mu_t$). To approximate the analogous tangent vector field,
we use a finite difference over a time step that sits between two time scales
of the system -- long enough for a large-$N$ evolution ($\mu_t$) to emerge but
short enough to satisfactorily approximate the derivative object used in the
Euler scheme. The emergence of the limiting behavior ensures the optimal
transport maps closely approximate the vector field describing the bulk
distribution's smooth evolution instead of the individual particles' more
chaotic movements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with two
illustrative examples, Gaussian diffusion and a cell chemotaxis model, and show
that our method succeeds in predicting the bulk behavior over relatively large
steps.

                                        <span>  Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking
and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum
systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the
required number of total state copies and classical computational resources.
Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more
computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key
quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains
as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed
performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a
projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST
based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS
method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a
general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum
of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the
Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to
$O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r<2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal
bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that
the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state
copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of
$O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed
PCS method.

                                        <span>  Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting
intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are
analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms
from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1)
prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2)
that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a
reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For
online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the
regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost)
over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the
single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant
difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions
made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about
the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a
fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature
results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori
assuming that all time varying parameters are bounded, which for many
optimization tasks is not unrealistic, but is a non starter in control
applications. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the
regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control
based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion
about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control and ask the
following question "Are regret optimal control strategies deployable?"

                                        <span>  Mechanical ventilation is a critical life support intervention that delivers
controlled air and oxygen to a patient's lungs, assisting or replacing
spontaneous breathing. While several data-driven approaches have been proposed
to optimize ventilator control strategies, they often lack interpretability and
alignment with domain knowledge, hindering clinical adoption. This paper
presents a methodology for interpretable reinforcement learning (RL) aimed at
improving mechanical ventilation control as part of connected health systems.
Using a causal, nonparametric model-based off-policy evaluation, we assess RL
policies for their ability to enhance patient-specific outcomes-specifically,
increasing blood oxygen levels (SpO2), while avoiding aggressive ventilator
settings that may cause ventilator-induced lung injuries and other
complications. Through numerical experiments on real-world ICU data from the
MIMIC-III database, we demonstrate that our interpretable decision tree policy
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep RL methods while
outperforming standard behavior cloning approaches. The results highlight the
potential of interpretable, data-driven decision support systems to improve
safety and efficiency in personalized ventilation strategies, paving the way
for seamless integration into connected healthcare environments.

                                        <span>  This article presents a formalism inspired by Dennett's notion of the
intentional stance. Whereas Dennett's treatment of these concepts is informal,
we aim to provide a more formal analogue. We introduce a framework based on
stochastic processes with inputs and outputs, in which we can talk precisely
about *interpreting* systems as having *normative-epistemic states*, which
combine belief-like and desire-like features. Our framework is based on
optimality but nevertheless allows us to model some forms of bounded cognition.
  One might expect that the systems that can be described in
normative-epistemic terms would be some special subset of all systems, but we
show that this is not the case: every system admits a (possibly trivial)
normative-epistemic interpretation, and those that can be *uniquely specified*
by a normative-epistemic description are exactly the deterministic ones.
Finally, we show that there is a suitable notion of Bayesian updating for
normative-epistemic states, which we call *value-laden filtering*, since it
involves both normative and epistemic elements. For unbounded cognition it is
always permissible to attribute beliefs that update in this way. This is not
always the case for bounded cognition, but we give a sufficient condition under
which it is.
  This paper gives an overview of our framework aimed at cognitive scientists,
with a formal mathematical treatment given in a companion paper.

                                        <span>  This research investigates a multi-product capacitated lot-sizing and
scheduling problem incorporating a novel learning effect, namely the
period-based learning effect. This is inspired by a real case in a core
analysis laboratory under a job shop setting. Accordingly, a Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) model is extended based on the big-bucket
formulation, optimizing the total tardiness and overtime costs. Given the
complexity of the problem, a cutting plane method is employed to simplify the
model. Afterward, three matheuristic methods based on the rolling horizon
approach are devised, incorporating two lower bounds and a local search
heuristic. Furthermore, a post-processing approach is implemented to
incorporate lot-streaming possibility. Computational experiments demonstrate:
1) the simplified model performs effectively in terms of both solution quality
and computational time; and 2) although the model encounters challenges with
large-scale instances, the proposed matheuristic methods achieve satisfactory
outcomes; and 3) it can be inferred that the complexity of the models and
solution methods are independent of the learning effect; however, the value of
learning effect may impact the performance of the lower bounds; 4) in
manufacturing settings, where the lot-streaming is possible, incorporating
post-processing can drastically improve the objective function; 5) the impact
of the period-based learning effect in the results is significant, and the
model's sensitivity to time-based parameters (e.g., learning rate) is more than
cost-based ones (e.g., tardiness cost).

optimal control problem with additive noise and integral state constraint are
derived based on time-implicit and finite element discretization. The
continuous and discrete first-order optimality conditions are deduced by
constructing the Lagrange functional, which contains forward-backward
stochastic parabolic equations and a variational equation. The fully discrete
version of forward-backward stochastic parabolic equations is introduced as an
auxiliary problem and the optimal strong convergence orders are estimated,
which further allows the optimal a priori error estimates for control, state,
adjoint state and multiplier to be derived. Then, a simple and yet efficient
gradient projection algorithm is proposed to solve stochastic parabolic control
problem and its convergence rate is proved. Numerical experiments are carried
out to illustrate the theoretical findings.

perturbations of atmospheric states to realize specified changes in subsequent
weather. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to
find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled
variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method
first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as
accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as
temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using a numerical
weather prediction (NWP) model. Then a convex optimization problem is
formulated to achieve various control specifications involving not only
quadratic functions but also absolute values and maximum values of the
controlled variables and initial atmospheric variables in the cost function and
constraints. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble
experiment using the NWP model. The experiments showed that the identified
perturbations successfully realized specified spatial distributions of
accumulated precipitation.

                                        <span>  The continuous nonlinear resource allocation problem (CONRAP) has broad
applications in economics, engineering, production and inventory management,
and often serves as a subproblem in complex programming. Without relying on
monotonicity assumptions for the objective and constraint functions, we propose
two Lagrangian dual algorithms for solving two types of CONRAP. Both algorithms
determine an update strategy for the Lagrange multiplier, utilizing the values
of the objective and constraint functions at the current and previous
iterations. This strategy accelerates the process of finding dual optimal
solutions. Subsequently, leveraging the problem's convexity, the primal optimal
solution is either directly identified or derived by solving a one-dimensional
linear equation. We also prove that both algorithms converge to optimal
solutions within a finite number of iterations. Numerical experiments on six
types of practical test problems illustrate the superior computational
efficiency of the proposed algorithms. For test problems with a general
inequality constraint, the first algorithm achieves a CPU time reduction
exceeding an order of magnitude compared to solvers such as Gurobi and CVX. For
test problems with a linear equality constraint, the second algorithm
consistently outperforms four existing algorithms, delivering an improvement of
over two orders of magnitude in computational efficiency.

distributed space systems, resilient constellations, and autonomous rendezvous
and docking operations. A critical emerging application is collaborative
spacecraft servicing, which encompasses on-orbit maintenance, space debris
removal, and swarm-based satellite repositioning. These missions involve
servicing spacecraft interacting with malfunctioning or defunct spacecraft
under challenging conditions, such as limited state information, measurement
inaccuracies, and erratic target behaviors. Existing approaches often rely on
assumptions of full state knowledge or single-integrator dynamics, which are
impractical for real-world applications involving second-order spacecraft
dynamics. This work addresses these challenges by developing a distributed
state estimation and tracking framework that requires only relative position
measurements and operates under partial state information. A novel
$\rho$-filter is introduced to reconstruct unknown states using locally
available information, and a Lyapunov-based deep neural network adaptive
controller is developed that adaptively compensates for uncertainties stemming
from unknown spacecraft dynamics. To ensure the collaborative spacecraft
regulation problem is well-posed, a trackability condition is defined. A
Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to ensure exponential convergence
of errors in state estimation and spacecraft regulation to a neighborhood of
the origin under the trackability condition. The developed method eliminates
the need for expensive velocity sensors or extensive pre-training, offering a
practical and robust solution for spacecraft servicing in complex, dynamic
environments.

need for methods to collect data over time and in naturalistic or potentially
private environments. HRI researchers have increasingly used the diary method
for these studies, asking study participants to self-administer a structured
data collection instrument, i.e., a diary, over a period of time. Although the
diary method offers a unique window into settings that researchers may not have
access to, they also lack the interactivity and probing that interview-based
methods offer. In this paper, we explore a novel data collection method in
which a robot plays the role of an interactive diary. We developed the Diary
Robot system and performed in-home deployments for a week to evaluate the
feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Using traditional text-based
and audio-based diaries as benchmarks, we found that robots are able to
effectively elicit the intended information. We reflect on our findings, and
describe scenarios where the utilization of robots in diary studies as a data
collection instrument may be especially applicable.

                                        <span>  Ensuring robot safety can be challenging; user-defined constraints can miss
edge cases, policies can become unsafe even when trained from safe data, and
safety can be subjective. Thus, we learn about robot safety by showing policy
trajectories to a human who flags unsafe behavior. From this binary feedback,
we use the statistical method of conformal prediction to identify a region of
states, potentially in learned latent space, guaranteed to contain a
user-specified fraction of future policy errors. Our method is
sample-efficient, as it builds on nearest neighbor classification and avoids
withholding data as is common with conformal prediction. By alerting if the
robot reaches the suspected unsafe region, we obtain a warning system that
mimics the human's safety preferences with guaranteed miss rate. From video
labeling, our system can detect when a quadcopter visuomotor policy will fail
to steer through a designated gate. We present an approach for policy
improvement by avoiding the suspected unsafe region. With it we improve a model
predictive controller's safety, as shown in experimental testing with 30
quadcopter flights across 6 navigation tasks. Code and videos are provided.

                                        <span>  Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective
general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities --
including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation.
For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely
on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot
policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions
solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose
FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies
on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily
available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We
combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language
generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot
manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that
require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a
zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal
prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same
recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both
diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA)
models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to
increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.

their conversational abilities, enabling interactions closely resembling human
dialogue. However, these models introduce safety and security concerns in HRI,
as they are vulnerable to manipulation that can bypass built-in safety
measures. Imagining a social robot deployed in a home, this work aims to
understand how everyday users try to exploit a language model to violate
ethical principles, such as by prompting the robot to act like a life partner.
We conducted a pilot study involving 21 university students who interacted with
a Misty robot, attempting to circumvent its safety mechanisms across three
scenarios based on specific HRI ethical principles: attachment, freedom, and
empathy. Our results reveal that participants employed five techniques,
including insulting and appealing to pity using emotional language. We hope
this work can inform future research in designing strong safeguards to ensure
ethical and secure human-robot interactions.

genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize the controller parameters,
addressing the challenges in determining PID controller parameters for highly
nonlinear systems like robotic arms compared to traditional methods. The

that the robotic arm system operates with high precision and stability.
Additionally, the shortened trajectory tracking response time enhances the

research not only confirms the suitability of PID-GA for robotic arms and
similar systems but also opens new avenues for applying this algorithm to real

significant impact on our lives, with intelligent systems increasingly
performing tasks traditionally performed by humans. Efficient knowledge
transfer requires matching the mental model of the human teacher with the
capabilities of the robot learner. This paper introduces the Mental Model
Mismatch (MMM) Score, a feedback mechanism designed to quantify and reduce
mismatches by aligning human teaching behavior with robot learning behavior.
Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we analyze teacher intentions in natural
language to generate adaptive feedback. A study with 150 participants teaching
a virtual robot to solve a puzzle game shows that intention-based feedback
significantly outperforms traditional performance-based feedback or no
feedback. The results suggest that intention-based feedback improves
instructional outcomes, improves understanding of the robot's learning process
and reduces misconceptions. This research addresses a critical gap in
human-robot interaction (HRI) by providing a method to quantify and mitigate
discrepancies between human mental models and robot capabilities, with the goal
of improving robot learning and human teaching effectiveness.

allows them to actively reason and decide on what new data to acquire for tasks
such as mapping, object discovery, and environmental assessment. Existing
methods, such as frontier-based methods, rely heavily on 3D map operations,
which are limited by map quality and often overlook valuable context from
visual cues. This work aims at leveraging 2D visual cues for efficient
autonomous exploration, addressing the limitations of extracting goal poses
from a 3D map. We propose a image-only frontier-based exploration system, with
FrontierNet as a core component developed in this work. FrontierNet is a
learning-based model that (i) detects frontiers, and (ii) predicts their
information gain, from posed RGB images enhanced by monocular depth priors. Our
approach provides an alternative to existing 3D-dependent exploration systems,
achieving a 16% improvement in early-stage exploration efficiency, as validated
through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.

                                        <span>  Robotic guide dogs hold significant potential to enhance the autonomy and
mobility of blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals by offering universal
assistance over unstructured terrains at affordable costs. However, the design
of robotic guide dogs remains underexplored, particularly in systematic aspects
such as gait controllers, navigation behaviors, interaction methods, and verbal
explanations. Our study addresses this gap by conducting user studies with 18
BVI participants, comprising 15 cane users and three guide dog users.
Participants interacted with a quadrupedal robot and provided both quantitative
and qualitative feedback. Our study revealed several design implications, such
as a preference for a learning-based controller and a rigid handle, gradual
turns with asymmetric speeds, semantic communication methods, and
explainability. The study also highlighted the importance of customization to
support users with diverse backgrounds and preferences, along with practical
concerns such as battery life, maintenance, and weather issues. These findings
offer valuable insights and design implications for future research and
development of robotic guide dogs.

                                        <span>  Uncertainty estimation is an indispensable capability for AI-enabled,
safety-critical applications, e.g. autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis.
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) use Bayesian statistics to provide both
classification predictions and uncertainty estimation, but they suffer from
high computational overhead associated with random number generation and
repeated sample iterations. Furthermore, BNNs are not immediately amenable to
acceleration through compute-in-memory architectures due to the frequent memory
writes necessary after each RNG operation. To address these challenges, we
present an ASIC that integrates 360 fJ/Sample Gaussian RNG directly into the
SRAM memory words. This integration reduces RNG overhead and enables
fully-parallel compute-in-memory operations for BNNs. The prototype chip
achieves 5.12 GSa/s RNG throughput and 102 GOp/s neural network throughput
while occupying 0.45 mm2, bringing AI uncertainty estimation to edge
computation.

visual, auditory and linguistic domains, adapting to the ceaseless interplay
between steganographic concealment and steganalytic revelation. This study
seeks to extend the horizons of what constitutes a viable steganographic medium
by introducing a steganographic paradigm in robotic motion control. Based on
the observation of the robot's inherent sensitivity to changes in its
environment, we propose a methodology to encode messages as environmental
stimuli influencing the motions of the robotic agent and to decode messages
from the resulting motion trajectory. The constraints of maximal robot
integrity and minimal motion deviation are established as fundamental
principles underlying secrecy. As a proof of concept, we conduct experiments in
simulated environments across various manipulation tasks, incorporating robotic
embodiments equipped with generalist multimodal policies.

                                        <span>  Endovascular navigation is a crucial aspect of minimally invasive procedures,
where precise control of curvilinear instruments like guidewires is critical
for successful interventions. A key challenge in this task is accurately
predicting the evolving shape of the guidewire as it navigates through the
vasculature, which presents complex deformations due to interactions with the
vessel walls. Traditional segmentation methods often fail to provide accurate
real-time shape predictions, limiting their effectiveness in highly dynamic
environments. To address this, we propose SplineFormer, a new transformer-based
architecture, designed specifically to predict the continuous, smooth shape of
the guidewire in an explainable way. By leveraging the transformer's ability,
our network effectively captures the intricate bending and twisting of the
guidewire, representing it as a spline for greater accuracy and smoothness. We
integrate our SplineFormer into an end-to-end robot navigation system by
leveraging the condensed information. The experimental results demonstrate that
our SplineFormer is able to perform endovascular navigation autonomously and
achieves a 50% success rate when cannulating the brachiocephalic artery on the
real robot.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) in the real world necessitates the development of
procedures that enable agents to explore without causing harm to themselves or
others. The most successful solutions to the problem of safe RL leverage
offline data to learn a safe-set, enabling safe online exploration. However,
this approach to safe-learning is often constrained by the demonstrations that
are available for learning.
  In this paper we investigate the influence of the quantity and quality of
data used to train the initial safe learning problem offline on the ability to
learn safe-RL policies online. Specifically, we focus on tasks with spatially
extended goal states where we have few or no demonstrations available.
Classically this problem is addressed either by using hand-designed controllers
to generate data or by collecting user-generated demonstrations. However, these
methods are often expensive and do not scale to more complex tasks and
environments. To address this limitation we propose an unsupervised RL-based
offline data collection procedure, to learn complex and scalable policies
without the need for hand-designed controllers or user demonstrations. Our
research demonstrates the significance of providing sufficient demonstrations
for agents to learn optimal safe-RL policies online, and as a result, we
propose optimistic forgetting, a novel online safe-RL approach that is
practical for scenarios with limited data. Further, our unsupervised data
collection approach highlights the need to balance diversity and optimality for
safe online exploration.

transformed logistics and supply chain management, providing a fast, and
environmentally friendly alternative to traditional ground transportation
methods;Provide users with a real-world experience, virtual service providers
need to collect up-to-the-minute delivery information from edge devices. To
address this challenge, 1) a reinforcement learning approach is introduced to
enable drones with fast training capabilities and the ability to autonomously
adapt to new virtual scenarios for effective resource allocation.2) A semantic
communication framework for meta-universes is proposed, which utilizes the
extraction of semantic information to reduce the communication cost and
incentivize the transmission of information for meta-universe services.3) In
order to ensure that user information security, a lightweight authentication
and key agreement scheme is designed between the drone and the user by
introducing blockchain technology. In our experiments, the drone adaptation
performance is improved by about 35\%, and the local offloading rate can reach
90\% with the increase of the number of base stations. The semantic
communication system proposed in this paper is compared with the Cross Entropy
baseline model. Introducing blockchain technology the throughput of the
transaction is maintained at a stable value with different number of drones.

combines a deep learning model with a rule-based engine depending on the agent
state. The deep learning model has been trained using reinforcement learning.
The rule-based engine uses expert knowledge to deal with specific situations.
The navigation module incorporates several strategies to explain the drone
decision based on its observation space, and different mechanisms for including
human decisions in the navigation process. Finally, this paper proposes an
evaluation methodology based on defining several scenarios and analyzing the
performance of the different strategies according to metrics adapted to each
scenario. Results: Two main navigation problems have been studied. For the
first scenario (reaching known targets), it has been possible to obtain a 90%
task completion rate, reducing significantly the number of collisions thanks to
the rule-based engine. For the second scenario, it has been possible to reduce
20% of the time required to locate all the targets using the reinforcement
learning model. Conclusions: Reinforcement learning is a very good strategy to
learn policies for drone navigation, but in critical situations, it is
necessary to complement it with a rule-based module to increase task success
rate.

engineered for rolling surfaces. Our focus is on the kinematic intricacies of
rolling contact systems, which are investigated through a motion planning lens.
Beyond summarizing the approaches to single-contact rotational surfaces, we
explore the challenging domain of spin-rolling multi-contact systems. Our work
proposes solutions for the higher-dimensional problem of multiple rotating
objects in contact. Venturing beyond kinematics, these methodologies find
application across a spectrum of domains, including rolling robots,
reconfigurable swarm robotics, micro/nano manipulation, and nonprehensile
manipulations. Through meticulously examining established planning strategies,
we unveil their practical implementations in various real-world scenarios, from
intricate dexterous manipulation tasks to the nimble manoeuvring of rolling
robots and even shape planning of multi-contact swarms of particles. This study
introduces the persistent challenges and unexplored frontiers of robotics,
intricately linked to both path planning and mechanism design. As we illuminate
existing solutions, we also set the stage for future breakthroughs in this
dynamic and rapidly evolving field by highlighting the critical importance of
addressing rolling contact problems.

are online in nature, many applications require offline algorithms without
environment interactions. Tackling this problem in the offline setting,
however, presents significant challenges that require non-trivial, multi-stage
optimization processes with non-stationary rewards. In this work, we present a
novel offline algorithm that enhances diversity using an objective based on Van
der Waals (VdW) force and successor features, and eliminates the need to learn
a previously used skill discriminator. Moreover, by conditioning the value
function and policy on a pre-trained Functional Reward Encoding (FRE), our
method allows for better handling of non-stationary rewards and provides
zero-shot recall of all skills encountered during training, significantly
expanding the set of skills learned in prior work. Consequently, our algorithm
benefits from receiving a consistently strong diversity signal (VdW), and
enjoys more stable and efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method in generating diverse skills for two robotic tasks in simulation:
locomotion of a quadruped and local navigation with obstacle traversal.

closely with them. There are some wild animals that are not always safe to
approach. Therefore, we suggest this system for observing wildlife. Android
phones can be used by users to see live events. Wildlife observers can thus get
a close-up view of wild animals by employing this robotic vehicle. The commands
are delivered to the system via a Wi-Fi module. As we developed the technology
to enable our robot to deal with the challenges of maintaining continuous
surveillance of a target, we found that our robot needed to be able to move
silently and purposefully when monitoring a natural target without being

to turn on. The driver motors, which deliver the essential signal outputs to
drive the vehicle movement, are now in charge of driving the motors.

                                        <span>  We provide a general and malleable heuristic for the air conflict resolution
problem. This heuristic is based on a new neighborhood structure for searching
the solution space of trajectories and flight-levels. Using unsupervised
learning, the core idea of our heuristic is to cluster the conflict points and
disperse them in various flight levels. Our first algorithm is called Cluster &
Disperse and in each iteration it assigns the most problematic flights in each
cluster to another flight-level. In effect, we shuffle them between the
flight-levels until we achieve a well-balanced configuration. The Cluster &
Disperse algorithm then uses any horizontal plane conflict resolution algorithm
as a subroutine to solve these well-balanced instances. Nevertheless, we
develop a novel algorithm for the horizontal plane based on a similar idea.
That is we cluster and disperse the conflict points spatially in the same
flight level using the gradient descent and a social force. We use a novel
maneuver making flights travel on an arc instead of a straight path which is
based on the aviation routine of the Radius to Fix legs. Our algorithms can
handle a high density of flights within a reasonable computation time. We put
their performance in context with some notable algorithms from the literature.
Being a general framework, a particular strength of the Cluster & Disperse is
its malleability in allowing various constraints regarding the aircraft or the
environment to be integrated with ease. This is in contrast to the models for
instance based on mixed integer programming.

                                        <span>  In daily domestic settings, frequently used objects like cups often have
unfixed positions and multiple instances within the same category, and their
carriers frequently change as well. As a result, it becomes challenging for a
robot to efficiently navigate to a specific instance. To tackle this challenge,
the robot must capture and update scene changes and plans continuously.
However, current object navigation approaches primarily focus on the semantic
level and lack the ability to dynamically update scene representation. In
contrast, this paper captures the relationships between frequently used objects
and their static carriers. It constructs an open-vocabulary
Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and updates the carrying status during
robot navigation to reflect the dynamic changes of the scene. Based on the
CRSG, we further propose an instance navigation strategy that models the
navigation process as a Markov Decision Process. At each step, decisions are
informed by the Large Language Model's commonsense knowledge and
visual-language feature similarity. We designed a series of long-sequence
navigation tasks for frequently used everyday items in the Habitat simulator.
The results demonstrate that by updating the CRSG, the robot can efficiently
navigate to moved targets. Additionally, we deployed our algorithm on a real
robot and validated its practical effectiveness. The project page can be found

remains a significant challenge in robotic manipulation. Policy code generation
methods use executable code to connect high-level task descriptions and
low-level action sequences, leveraging the generalization capabilities of large
language models and atomic skill libraries. In this work, we propose Robotic
Programmer (RoboPro), a robotic foundation model, enabling the capability of
perceiving visual information and following free-form instructions to perform
robotic manipulation with policy code in a zero-shot manner. To address low
efficiency and high cost in collecting runtime code data for robotic tasks, we
devise Video2Code to synthesize executable code from extensive videos
in-the-wild with off-the-shelf vision-language model and code-domain large
language model. Extensive experiments show that RoboPro achieves the
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on robotic manipulation in both
simulators and real-world environments. Specifically, the zero-shot success
rate of RoboPro on RLBench surpasses the state-of-the-art model GPT-4o by
11.6%, which is even comparable to a strong supervised training baseline.
Furthermore, RoboPro is robust to variations on API formats and skill sets.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) have boosted a large
amount of applications. However, traditional LIO systems tend to focus more on
localization rather than mapping, with maps consisting mostly of sparse
geometric elements, which is not ideal for downstream tasks. Recent emerging
neural field technology has great potential in dense mapping, but pure LiDAR
mapping is difficult to work on high-dynamic vehicles. To mitigate this
challenge, we present a new solution that tightly couples geometric kinematics
with neural fields to enhance simultaneous state estimation and dense mapping
capabilities. We propose both semi-coupled and tightly coupled Kinematic-Neural
LIO (KN-LIO) systems that leverage online SDF decoding and iterated error-state
Kalman filtering to fuse laser and inertial data. Our KN-LIO minimizes
information loss and improves accuracy in state estimation, while also
accommodating asynchronous multi-LiDAR inputs. Evaluations on diverse
high-dynamic datasets demonstrate that our KN-LIO achieves performance on par
with or superior to existing state-of-the-art solutions in pose estimation and
offers improved dense mapping accuracy over pure LiDAR-based methods. The
relevant code and datasets will be made available at https://**.

                                        <span>  Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a concise yet expressive framework for
specifying and reasoning about spatio-temporal behaviors of robotic systems.
Attractively, STL admits the notion of robustness, the degree to which an input
signal satisfies or violates an STL specification, thus providing a nuanced
evaluation of system performance. Notably, the differentiability of STL
robustness enables direct integration to robotics workflows that rely on
gradient-based optimization, such as trajectory optimization and deep learning.
However, existing approaches to evaluating and differentiating STL robustness
rely on recurrent computations, which become inefficient with longer sequences,
limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present
STLCG++, a masking-based approach that parallelizes STL robustness evaluation
and backpropagation across timesteps, achieving more than 1000x faster
computation time than the recurrent approach. We also introduce a smoothing
technique for differentiability through time interval bounds, expanding STL's
applicability in gradient-based optimization tasks over spatial and temporal
variables. Finally, we demonstrate STLCG++'s benefits through three robotics
use cases and provide open-source Python libraries in JAX and PyTorch for
seamless integration into modern robotics workflows.

ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and robots. This paper
introduces a perception framework that enables mobile robots to understand and
share information about human actions in a decentralized way. The framework
first allows each robot to build a spatial graph representing its surroundings,
which it then shares with other robots. This shared spatial data is combined
with temporal information to track human behavior over time. A swarm-inspired
decision-making process is used to ensure all robots agree on a unified
interpretation of the human's actions. Results show that adding more robots and
incorporating longer time sequences improve prediction accuracy. Additionally,
the consensus mechanism increases system resilience, making the multi-robot
setup more reliable in dynamic industrial settings.

or road monitoring system. An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms,
and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to
prevent it from recurring. This work focuses on classifying traffic scenes into
specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic
scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and
relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of
a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for
an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that
fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work
introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of
traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation
with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task.
When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of
57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly
(DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from
the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.

                                        <span>  In the field of collaborative robotics, the ability to communicate spatial
information like planned trajectories and shared environment information is
crucial. When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or
GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before
shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted.
Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no
initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a
novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate
frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from
associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to
determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial
knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame
alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four
robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a
tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization.

a region to completely scan or survey an area of interest using one or multiple
mobile robots. Robots equipped with sensors and cameras can collect vast
amounts of data on crop health, soil conditions, and weather patterns. Advanced
analytics can then be applied to this data to make informed decisions,
improving overall farm management. In this paper, we will demonstrate one
approach to find the optimal coverage path of an agricultural field using a
single robot, and one using multiple robots. For the single robot, we used a
wavefront coverage algorithm that generates a sequence of locations that the
robot needs to follow. For the multi-robot approach, the proposed approach
consists of two steps: dividing the agricultural field into convex polygonal
areas to optimally distribute them among the robots, and generating an optimal
coverage path to ensure minimum coverage time for each of the polygonal areas.

                                        <span>  The Robot Operating System (ROS) is one of the most popular middleware for
developing robot applications, but it is subject to major shortcomings when
applied to real-time robotic systems in safety-critical environments. For this
reason, ROS 2 was released in 2017 for implementing real-time capabilities in
distributed robotic systems while supporting the most prominent aspects of the
original ROS. There is still not much work done to provide formal guarantees
and correctness of a ROS program. In this paper, we propose a framework to
address this challenging problem of guaranteeing the correct behaviour of
robotic systems. We propose a formal modelling of a ROS 2 program, and also
describe the program using a network of timed automata. We then prove that the
sets of executions of a ROS program in the model and in the network of timed
automata are the same. Thus to analyze a publisher-subscriber scenario of ROS 2
program, our algorithm first converts the program into the model, and then into
the network of timed automata. The applicability and validity of our approach
are verified by conducting several experiments on a simplified system and an
actual robotic system, and the results and limitations are discussed.

                                        <span>  A recent set of techniques in the robotics community, known as certifiably
correct methods, frames robotics problems as polynomial optimization problems
(POPs) and applies convex, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations to either
find or certify their global optima. In parallel, differentiable optimization
allows optimization problems to be embedded into end-to-end learning frameworks
and has received considerable attention in the robotics community. In this
paper, we consider the ill effect of convergence to spurious local minima in
the context of learning frameworks that use differentiable optimization. We
present SDPRLayers, an approach that seeks to address this issue by combining
convex relaxations with implicit differentiation techniques to provide
certifiably correct solutions and gradients throughout the training process. We
provide theoretical results that outline conditions for the correctness of
these gradients and provide efficient means for their computation. Our approach
is first applied to two simple-but-demonstrative simulated examples, which
expose the potential pitfalls of reliance on local optimization in existing,
state-of-the-art, differentiable optimization methods. We then apply our method
in a real-world application: we train a deep neural network to detect image
keypoints for robot localization in challenging lighting conditions. We provide
our open-source, PyTorch implementation of SDPRLayers.

Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement
Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical
Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning
approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner
generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement,
and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a
representation suitable for abstract planning. We evaluate our system on
varying numbers of objects, rooms, and problem types in AI2-THOR simulated
environments with promising results.

                                        <span>  One of the current trends in robotics is to employ large language models
(LLMs) to provide non-predefined command execution and natural human-robot
interaction. It is useful to have an environment map together with its language
representation, which can be further utilized by LLMs. Such a comprehensive
scene representation enables numerous ways of interaction with the map for
autonomously operating robots. In this work, we present an approach that
enhances incremental implicit mapping through the integration of
vision-language features. Specifically, we (i) propose a decoder optimization
technique for implicit language maps which can be used when new objects appear
on the scene, and (ii) address the problem of inconsistent vision-language
predictions between different viewing positions. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LiLMaps and solid improvements in performance.

                                        <span>  Visual SLAM is a key technology for many autonomous systems. However,
tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM
systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging
strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap
merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not
sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall
system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its
full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original
system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set
of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We
evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3
with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple
approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show
that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on
these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches
for SLAM systems.

                                        <span>  Bayesian estimation is a vital tool in robotics as it allows systems to
update the robot state belief using incomplete information from noisy sensors.
To render the state estimation problem tractable, many systems assume that the
motion and measurement noise, as well as the state distribution, are unimodal
and Gaussian. However, there are numerous scenarios and systems that do not
comply with these assumptions. Existing nonparametric filters that are used to
model multimodal distributions have drawbacks that limit their ability to
represent a diverse set of distributions. This paper introduces a novel
approach to nonparametric Bayesian filtering on motion groups, designed to
handle multimodal distributions using harmonic exponential distributions. This
approach leverages two key insights of harmonic exponential distributions: a)
the product of two distributions can be expressed as the element-wise addition
of their log-likelihood Fourier coefficients, and b) the convolution of two
distributions can be efficiently computed as the tensor product of their
Fourier coefficients. These observations enable the development of an efficient
and asymptotically exact solution to the Bayes filter up to the band limit of a
Fourier transform. We demonstrate our filter's performance compared with
established nonparametric filtering methods across simulated and real-world
localization tasks.

large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional perception systems that rely
on rigid, label-based annotations, it integrates real-time, multimodal sensor
data into a unified, LLMs-readable knowledge base, enabling LLMs to dynamically
understand and respond to complex driving environments. To overcome the
inherent latency and modality limitations of LLMs, a proactive
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is designed for AD, combined with a
chain-of-thought prompting mechanism, ensuring rapid and context-rich
understanding. Experimental results using real-world Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) datasets demonstrate significant improvements in perception and
prediction performance, highlighting the potential of this framework to enhance
safety, adaptability, and decision-making in next-generation AD systems.

                                        <span>  The ICP registration algorithm has been a preferred method for LiDAR-based
robot localization for nearly a decade. However, even in modern SLAM solutions,
ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned
environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources
of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate
directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a
sensor-fusion setup afterward.
  In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy
mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the
efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in
the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the
effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem
of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of
TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for
the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time.
Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the
ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the
optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis
are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated
experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy
mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external
estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide
better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned
parameters.

cooperative inspection missions using a fleet of multirotor drones, with a
focus on wind turbine inspection. The approach generates safe, feasible flight
paths that adhere to time-sensitive constraints and vehicle limitations by
formulating an optimization problem based on Signal Temporal Logic (STL)

                                        <span>  Effective movement primitives should be capable of encoding and generating a
rich repertoire of trajectories -- typically collected from human
demonstrations -- conditioned on task-defining parameters such as vision or
language inputs. While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis,
which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear
subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high
dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex
task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically
with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow
Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion
manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow
matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn
task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned
motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory
generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce
complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing
methods.

of open-vocabulary object manipulation. In this task, the model is required to
make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images
before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional
methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is
executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We
propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by
aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions.
We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input
trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions
between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict
manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1
dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks,
to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our method achieved
a higher prediction accuracy than baseline approaches.

                                        <span>  In safety-critical robot planning or control, manually specifying safety
constraints or learning them from demonstrations can be challenging. In this
article, we propose a certifiable alignment method for a robot to learn a
safety constraint in its model predictive control (MPC) policy with human
online directional feedback. To our knowledge, it is the first method to learn
safety constraints from human feedback. The proposed method is based on an
empirical observation: human directional feedback, when available, tends to
guide the robot toward safer regions. The method only requires the direction of
human feedback to update the learning hypothesis space. It is certifiable,
providing an upper bound on the total number of human feedback in the case of
successful learning, or declaring the hypothesis misspecification, i.e., the
true implicit safety constraint cannot be found within the specified hypothesis
space. We evaluated the proposed method using numerical examples and user
studies in two simulation games. Additionally, we implemented and tested the
proposed method on a real-world Franka robot arm performing mobile
water-pouring tasks. The results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our
method, showing that it enables a robot to successfully learn safety
constraints with a small handful (tens) of human directional corrections.

                                        <span>  For self-scheduling cascaded hydropower (S-CHP) facilities, medium-term
planning is a critical step that coordinates water availability over the
medium-term horizon, providing water usage guidance for their short-term
operations in wholesale market participation. Typically, medium-term planning
strategies (e.g., reservoir storage targets at the end of each short-term
period) are determined by either optimization methods or rules of thumb.
However, with the integration of variable renewable energy sources (VRESs),
optimization-based methods suffer from deviations between the anticipated and
actual reservoir storage, while rules of thumb could be financially
conservative, thereby compromising short-term operating profitability in
wholesale market participation. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based framework to derive medium-term planning policies for
VRES-integrated S-CHPs (VS-CHPs), which can leverage contextual information
underneath individual short-term periods and train planning policies by their
induced short-term operating profits in wholesale market participation. The
proposed DRL-based framework offers two practical merits. First, its planning
strategies consider both seasonal requirements of reservoir storage and needs
for short-term operating profits. Second, it adopts a multi-parametric
programming-based strategy to accelerate the expensive training process
associated with multi-step short-term operations. Finally, the DRL-based
framework is evaluated on a real-world VS-CHP, demonstrating its advantages
over current practice.

                                        <span>  Power systems are critical infrastructure in modern society, and power
outages can cause significant disruptions to communities and individuals' daily
lives. The resilience of a power system measures its ability to maintain power
supply during highly disruptive events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and
thunderstorms. Traditional methods for quantifying power system resilience
include statistics-based and simulation-based approaches. Statistics-based
methods offer a retrospective analysis of system performance without requiring
a physical model, while simulation-based methods necessitate detailed physical
system information and often simplify real-world scenarios. This paper
introduces a deep learning-based method for evaluating power system resilience
using historical power outage data. The method leverages the generalization
capabilities of deep learning models and incorporates socio-economic and
demographic factors as weighting terms to highlight the impacts on vulnerable
demographic groups. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
through two case studies: one with real historical outage data and the other
with simulated outage records. This approach provides valuable insights into
measuring power system resilience against hazardous weather events without
requiring a physical model of the target systems. The evaluation results can
further guide the planning of distributed energy resources for resilience
enhancement.

information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work
provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials
recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a
dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across
individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election
support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative
statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment,
disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now
cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions
that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how
limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and
targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the
population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic
resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause
systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide
opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global
improvements from limited and localized actions.

performance of the motion control systems. The LuGre model is a prevalent
friction model utilized to express this dynamic behavior. Since the LuGre model
is very comprehensive, friction compensation based on it might be challenging.
Inspired by this, we develop a novel observer to estimate and compensate for
LuGre friction. Furthermore, we present a Lyapunov stability analysis to show
that observer dynamics are asymptotically stable under certain conditions.
Compared to its counterparts, the proposed observer constitutes a simple and
standalone scheme that can be utilized with arbitrary control inputs in a
straightforward way. As a primary difference, the presented observer estimates
velocity and uses the velocity error to estimate friction in addition to
control input. The extensive simulations revealed that the introduced observer
enhances position and velocity tracking performance in the presence of
friction.

high-resolution stochastic traffic simulators. It employs abundant travel times
at the path-level, departing from the standard practice of resorting to scarce
segment-level sensor counts. The proposed approach is shown to tackle
high-dimensional instances in a sample-efficient way. For the first time, case
studies on 6 metropolitan highway networks are carried out, considering a total

calibration algorithm to systematically scale across networks. Compared to the
state-of-the-art simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)
algorithm, the proposed approach enhances fit to field data by an average 43.5%
with a maximum improvement of 80.0%, and does so within fewer simulation calls.

transforming grid are evolving rapidly. We review and systemize knowledge for a
special class of computation methods that solve large-scale power grid
optimization problems. Summary: Large-scale grid optimizations are pertinent
for, amongst other things, hedging against risk due to resource stochasticity,
evaluating aggregated DERs' impact on grid operation and design, and improving
the overall efficiency of grid operation in terms of cost, reliability, and
carbon footprint. We attribute the continual growth in scale and complexity of
grid optimizations to a large influx of new spatial and temporal features in
both transmission (T) and distribution (D) networks. Therefore, to systemize
knowledge in the field, we discuss the recent advancements in T and D systems
from the viewpoint of mechanistic physics-based and emerging data-driven
methods. Findings: We find that while mechanistic physics-based methods are
leading the science in solving large-scale grid optimizations, data-driven
techniques, especially physics-constrained ones, are emerging as an alternative
to solve otherwise intractable problems. We also find observable gaps in the
field and ascertain these gaps from the paper's literature review and by
collecting and synthesizing feedback from industry experts.

                                        <span>  Cylindrical manipulators are extensively used in industrial automation,
especially in emerging technologies like 3D printing, which represents a
significant future trend. However, controlling the trajectory of nonlinear
models with system uncertainties remains a critical challenge, often leading to
reduced accuracy and reliability. To address this, the study develops an
Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) integrated with Neural Networks (NNs)
to improve trajectory tracking for cylindrical manipulators. The ASMC leverages
the robustness of sliding mode control and the adaptability of neural networks
to handle uncertainties and dynamic variations effectively. Simulation results
validate that the proposed ASMC-NN achieves high trajectory tracking accuracy,
fast response time, and enhanced reliability, making it a promising solution
for applications in 3D printing and beyond.

                                        <span>  This paper extends recursive least squares (RLS) to include time-varying
regularization. This extension provides flexibility for updating the least
squares regularization term in real time. Existing results with constant
regularization imply that the parameter-estimation error dynamics of RLS are
globally attractive to zero if and only the regressor is weakly persistently
exciting. This work shows that, by extending classical RLS to include a
time-varying (fading) regularization term that converges to zero, the
parameter-estimation error dynamics are globally attractive to zero without
weakly persistent excitation. Moreover, if the fading regularization term
converges to zero in finite time, then the parameter estimation error also
converges to zero in finite time. Finally, we propose rank-1 fading
regularization (R1FR) RLS, a time-varying regularization algorithm with fading
regularization that converges to zero, and which runs in the same computational
complexity as classical RLS. Numerical examples are presented to validate
theoretical guarantees and to show how R1FR-RLS can protect against
over-regularization.

                                        <span>  To optimize battery dispatch, a model is required that can predict the state
of charge (SOC) trajectory and ensure dispatch is admissible (i.e., does not
lead to unexpected SOC saturation). But battery dispatch optimization is
inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and
discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper,
we consider a composition of energy storage elements that can charge or
discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of
the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite
battery SOC trajectory while ensuring admissibility of the resulting
(aggregated) power schedule and disaggregation to the individual energy storage
elements.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) in the real world necessitates the development of
procedures that enable agents to explore without causing harm to themselves or
others. The most successful solutions to the problem of safe RL leverage
offline data to learn a safe-set, enabling safe online exploration. However,
this approach to safe-learning is often constrained by the demonstrations that
are available for learning.
  In this paper we investigate the influence of the quantity and quality of
data used to train the initial safe learning problem offline on the ability to
learn safe-RL policies online. Specifically, we focus on tasks with spatially
extended goal states where we have few or no demonstrations available.
Classically this problem is addressed either by using hand-designed controllers
to generate data or by collecting user-generated demonstrations. However, these
methods are often expensive and do not scale to more complex tasks and
environments. To address this limitation we propose an unsupervised RL-based
offline data collection procedure, to learn complex and scalable policies
without the need for hand-designed controllers or user demonstrations. Our
research demonstrates the significance of providing sufficient demonstrations
for agents to learn optimal safe-RL policies online, and as a result, we
propose optimistic forgetting, a novel online safe-RL approach that is
practical for scenarios with limited data. Further, our unsupervised data
collection approach highlights the need to balance diversity and optimality for
safe online exploration.

operation of smart cities, addressing key challenges in efficiency,
productivity, and environmental sustainability. This paper comprehensively
reviews the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
optimizing ITS. Initially, we provide an extensive overview of ITS,
highlighting its components, operational principles, and overall effectiveness.
We then delve into the theoretical background of various LLM techniques, such
as GPT, T5, CTRL, and BERT, elucidating their relevance to ITS applications.
Following this, we examine the wide-ranging applications of LLMs within ITS,
including traffic flow prediction, vehicle detection and classification,
autonomous driving, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection. Our
analysis reveals how these advanced models can significantly enhance traffic
management and safety. Finally, we explore the challenges and limitations LLMs
face in ITS, such as data availability, computational constraints, and ethical
considerations. We also present several future research directions and
potential innovations to address these challenges. This paper aims to guide
researchers and practitioners through the complexities and opportunities of
integrating LLMs in ITS, offering a roadmap to create more efficient,
sustainable, and responsive next-generation transportation systems.

service in pressure vessel gasketed joints used in offshore pipelines. This is
a difficult task due to bolt load variations during the assembly process. In
this sense, the Elastic Interaction Coefficients Method has been developed in
previous works to define tightening sequences that provide the target load at
the end of the sequence in one or two passes. The method is very costly because
a complete sequence must be simulated and the load of every bolt must be
measured after each tightening operation. The present work validates this
method for Ring Type Joints and further develops a numerically and
experimentally validated new methodology that provides highly satisfactory
results with a significantly lower cost.

metrics for decision making is a well known challenge for urban risk analysis
systems. Existing systems are, in many cases, generalizations of previous
domain specific tools and or methodologies that may not cover all urban
interdependencies and makes it difficult to have homogeneous indicators. In
order to overcome this limitation while seeking for effective support to
decision makers, this article introduces a novel hybrid simulation framework
for risk mitigation. The framework is built on a proposed city concept that
considers urban space as a Complex Adaptive System composed by interconnected
Critical Infrastructures. In this concept, a Social System, which models daily
patterns and social interactions of the citizens in the Urban Landscape, drives
the CIs demand to configure the full city picture. The frameworks hybrid design
integrates agent based and network based modeling by breaking down city agents
into system dependent subagents, to enable both inter and intra system
interaction simulation, respectively. A layered structure of indicators at
different aggregation levels is also developed, to ensure that decisions are
not only data driven but also explainable. Therefore, the proposed simulation
framework can serve as a DSS tool that allows the quantitative analysis of the
impact of threats at different levels. First, system level metrics can be used
to get a broad view on the city resilience. Then, agent level metrics back
those figures and provide better explainability. On implementation, the
proposed framework enables component reusability (for eased coding), simulation
federation (enabling the integration of existing system oriented simulators),
discrete simulation in accelerated time (for rapid scenario simulation) and
decision oriented visualization (for informed outputs).

                                        <span>  Extremum-seeking control (ESC) is widely used to optimize performance when
the system dynamics are uncertain. However, sensitivity to sensor noise is an
important issue in ESC implementation due to the use of high-pass filters or
gradient estimators. To reduce the sensitivity of ESC to noise, this paper
investigates the use of adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) for
numerical differentiation. In particular, this paper develops extremum-seeking
control with adaptive input and state estimation (ESC/AISE), where the
high-pass filter of ESC is replaced by AISE to improve performance under sensor
noise. The effectiveness of ESC/AISE is illustrated via numerical examples.

                                        <span>  Trajectory prediction is a crucial element of guidance, navigation, and
control systems. This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods
based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state
estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements
to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called
AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret
formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To
estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first,
second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely
on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances.
For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position
and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The
performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the
$\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more
accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially
for complex target maneuvers.

estimation scheme is subject to the spatial non-stationarity and inevitably
power leakage in the beam domain. In this paper, a beam domain channel
estimation scheme is investigated for spatial non-stationary (SNS) massive MIMO
systems considering power leakage. %a novel beam domain channel estimation
scheme is proposed for spatial non-stationary (SNS) massive MIMO systems.
Specifically, a realistic massive MIMO beam domain channel model (BDCM) is
introduced to capture the spatial non-stationarity considering power leakage by
introducing the illustration of visibility region (VR). Then, a beam domain
structure-based sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (BDS-SAMP) scheme is
proposed based on the cross-block sparse structure and power ratio threshold of
beam domain channel. Finally, the simulation results validate the accuracy of
proposed BDS-SAMP scheme with low pilot overhead and reasonable complexity by
comparing with conventional schemes.

                                        <span>  The performance evaluation of sixth generation (6G) communication systems is
anticipated to be a controlled and repeatable process in the lab, which brings
up the demand for wireless channel emulators. However, channel emulation for 6G
space-time-frequency (STF) non-stationary channels is missing currently. In
this paper, a non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that accurately characterizes the
channel STF properties is introduced firstly. Then, a subspace-based method is
proposed for reconstructing the channel fading obtained from the GBSM and a
channel emulator architecture with frequency domain processing is presented for
6G MIMO systems. Moreover, the spatial time-varying channel transfer functions
(CTFs) of the channel simulation and the channel emulation are compared and
analyzed. The Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and delay PSD are further
derived and compared between the channel model simulation and subspace-based
emulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed channel emulator is
capable of reproducing the non-stationary channel characteristics.

underwater acoustic (UWA) channels is proposed. This model combines the BELLHOP
deterministic model and geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM), which provides
higher accuracy and flexibility. Different propagation components in shallow
water are classified as D-rays, R-rays and F-rays in the proposed model, where
D-rays are modeled by BELLHOP while both R-rays and F-rays are modeled by GBSM.
Some important channel statistical properties, including time-frequency
correlation function (TF-CF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), average
Doppler shift, and RMS Doppler spread are derived and simulated. Finally,
simulation results illustrate the correctness of the proposed model.

                                        <span>  We investigate the distributed online nonconvex optimization problem with
differential privacy over time-varying networks. Each node minimizes the sum of
several nonconvex functions while preserving the node's differential privacy.
We propose a privacy-preserving distributed online mirror descent algorithm for
nonconvex optimization, which uses the mirror descent to update decision
variables and the Laplace differential privacy mechanism to protect privacy.
Unlike the existing works, the proposed algorithm allows the cost functions to
be nonconvex, which is more applicable. Based upon these, we prove that if the
communication network is $B$-strongly connected and the constraint set is
compact, then by choosing the step size properly, the algorithm guarantees
$\epsilon$-differential privacy at each time. Furthermore, we prove that if the
local cost functions are $\beta$-smooth, then the regret over time horizon $T$
grows sublinearly while preserving differential privacy, with an upper bound
$O(\sqrt{T})$. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated
through numerical simulations.

approach to effectively manage and coordinate autonomous manufacturing assets,
thereby enhancing their responsiveness and flexibility to address a wide array
of production objectives and human preferences. Deviating from traditional
explicit modeling, GMS employs generative AI, including diffusion models and
ChatGPT, for implicit learning from envisioned futures, marking a shift from a
model-optimum to a training-sampling decision-making. Through the integration
of generative AI, GMS enables complex decision-making through interactive
dialogue with humans, allowing manufacturing assets to generate multiple
high-quality global decisions that can be iteratively refined based on human
feedback. Empirical findings showcase GMS's substantial improvement in system
resilience and responsiveness to uncertainties, with decision times reduced
from seconds to milliseconds. The study underscores the inherent creativity and
diversity in the generated solutions, facilitating human-centric
decision-making through seamless and continuous human-machine interactions.

                                        <span>  As offshore wind farms (OWFs) become increasingly prevalent in Northern
California and Southern Oregon, they introduce faster dynamics into the Western
Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system, reshaping its dynamic behavior.
Accordingly, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential to assess
high frequency dynamics of the WECC system with integrated OWFs. Against this
background, this paper presents the integration of detailed dynamic models of
OWFs into a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD software. The sequential
initialization technique is employed to facilitate the smooth initiation of a
large-scale system in an EMT simulation. The performance of the configured
model is assessed under wind speed variations and grounded faults,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the miniWECC system with OWFs. This system
serves as a valuable basic use case for validating the fast dynamic performance
of future WECC systems with high penetration of wind energy.

                                        <span>  Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate
carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water
resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the
current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower
generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term
CHP planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover
storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit
and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the
future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i)
constructing a model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation
that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii)
extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover
storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to
the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on
the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can
be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable
mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can
be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally,
numerical results on a CHP system of Portland General Electric demonstrate the
effectiveness of the presented framework in determining proper carryover
storage values to facilitate medium-term CHP planning.

mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater
Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in
multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs
(equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas
(equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones
with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and
the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between
transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of
SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget.
Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the
city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement
potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and
city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also
disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve
vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both
horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is
explicitly incorporated into the design objective.

Decomposition (d-SVD), which is fundamental in various signal processing
applications. Two scenarios are considered depending on the availability of the
data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest
is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second
scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product from two
different series of measurements. By combining the lightweight local rational
function approximation approach with parallel averaging consensus algorithms,
two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned
scenarios. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using two application examples:
decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and
decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a novel and non-trivial
truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal
to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the
communication cost associated with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results
show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution
with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the
state-of-the-art decentralized power method.

offline reinforcement learning (RL). At the core is a mean-reverting stochastic
differential equation (SDE) that transfers a complex action distribution into a
standard Gaussian and then samples actions conditioned on the environment state
with a corresponding reverse-time SDE, like a typical diffusion policy. We show
that such an SDE has a solution that we can use to calculate the log
probability of the policy, yielding an entropy regularizer that improves the
exploration of offline datasets. To mitigate the impact of inaccurate value
functions from out-of-distribution data points, we further propose to learn the
lower confidence bound of Q-ensembles for more robust policy improvement. By
combining the entropy-regularized diffusion policy with Q-ensembles in offline
RL, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks in D4RL
benchmarks. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Shared energy storage systems (ESS) present a promising solution to the
temporal imbalance between energy generation from renewable distributed
generators (DGs) and the power demands of prosumers. However, as DG penetration
rates rise, spatial energy imbalances become increasingly significant,
necessitating the integration of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within the
shared ESS framework. Two key challenges emerge in this context: the absence of
effective mechanisms and the greater difficulty for privacy protection due to
increased data communication. This research proposes a capacity renting
framework for shared ESS considering P2P energy trading of prosumers. In the
proposed framework, prosumers can participate in P2P energy trading and rent
capacities from shared ESS. A generalized Nash game is formulated to model the
trading process and the competitive interactions among prosumers, and the
variational equilibrium of the game is proved to be equivalent to the optimal
solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem. To address the privacy
protection concern, the problem is solved using the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) with the Paillier cryptosystem. Finally, numerical
simulations demonstrate the impact of P2P energy trading on the shared ESS
framework and validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving
algorithm.

differentiable nonconvex function with a nondifferentiable function for
multi-block variables, which is particularly relevant to tackle the multilinear
rank-($L_r$,$L_r$,1) block-term tensor decomposition model with a
regularization term. While existing algorithms often suffer from high
per-iteration complexity and slow convergence, this paper employs a unified
multi-step inertial accelerated doubly stochastic gradient descent method
tailored for structured rank-$\left(L_r, L_r, 1\right)$ tensor decomposition,
referred to as Midas-LL1. We also introduce an extended multi-step
variance-reduced stochastic estimator framework. Our analysis under this new
framework demonstrates the subsequential and sequential convergence of the
proposed algorithm under certain conditions and illustrates the sublinear
convergence rate of the subsequence, showing that the Midas-LL1 algorithm
requires at most $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations in expectation to
reach an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on
several datasets, and the results indicate that Midas-LL1 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both computational speed and solution
quality.

                                        <span>  Ensuring robot safety can be challenging; user-defined constraints can miss
edge cases, policies can become unsafe even when trained from safe data, and
safety can be subjective. Thus, we learn about robot safety by showing policy
trajectories to a human who flags unsafe behavior. From this binary feedback,
we use the statistical method of conformal prediction to identify a region of
states, potentially in learned latent space, guaranteed to contain a
user-specified fraction of future policy errors. Our method is
sample-efficient, as it builds on nearest neighbor classification and avoids
withholding data as is common with conformal prediction. By alerting if the
robot reaches the suspected unsafe region, we obtain a warning system that
mimics the human's safety preferences with guaranteed miss rate. From video
labeling, our system can detect when a quadcopter visuomotor policy will fail
to steer through a designated gate. We present an approach for policy
improvement by avoiding the suspected unsafe region. With it we improve a model
predictive controller's safety, as shown in experimental testing with 30
quadcopter flights across 6 navigation tasks. Code and videos are provided.

optimization over the past decade. We define the multilinear polytope as the
convex hull of the feasible region of a linearized binary polynomial
optimization problem. By representing the multilinear polytope with
hypergraphs, we investigate the connections between hypergraph acyclicity and
the complexity of the facial structure of the multilinear polytope. We
characterize the acyclic hypergraphs for which a polynomial-size extended
formulation for the multilinear polytope can be constructed in polynomial time.

sweeping processes. We define a new notion of approximate projection, which is
compatible with any numerical method for approximating exact projections, as
this new notion is not restricted to remain strictly within the set. We provide
several properties of the new approximate projections, which enable us to prove
the convergence of the inexact catching-up algorithm in three general
frameworks: prox-regular moving sets, subsmooth moving sets, and merely closed
sets. Additionally, we apply our numerical results to address complementarity
dynamical systems, particularly electrical circuits with ideal diodes. In this
context, we implement the inexact catching-up algorithm using a primal-dual
optimization method, which typically does not necessarily guarantee a feasible
point. Our results are illustrated through an electrical circuit with ideal
diodes. Our results recover classical existence results in the literature and
provide new insights into the numerical simulation of sweeping processes.

                                        <span>  We introduce the framework of quadratic-form optimal transport (QOT), whose
transport cost has the form $\iint c\,\mathrm{d}\pi \otimes\mathrm{d}\pi$ for
some coupling $\pi$ between two marginals. Interesting examples of
quadratic-form transport cost and their optimization include the variance of a
bivariate function, covariance, Kendall's tau, the Gromov--Wasserstein
distance, quadratic assignment problems, and quadratic regularization of
classic optimal transport. QOT leads to substantially different mathematical
structures compared to classic transport problems and many technical
challenges. We illustrate the fundamental properties of QOT, provide several
cases where explicit solutions are obtained, and give general lower bounds of
the optimal transport costs. For a wide class of cost functions, including the
rectangular cost functions, the QOT problem is solved by a new coupling called
the diamond transport, whose copula is supported on a diamond in the unit
square.

generalized twice differentiability and its novel characterization via
classical twice differentiability of the associated Moreau envelopes combined
with various limiting procedures for functions and sets.

forward-backward stochastic difference equations (FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es).
Firstly, we establish a pair of priori estimates for the solutions to forward
stochastic difference equations (FS$\bigtriangleup$Es) and backward stochastic
difference equations (BS$\bigtriangleup$Es) respectively. Then, to achieve
broader applicability, we utilize a set of domination-monotonicity conditions
which are more lenient than general ones. Using these conditions, we apply
continuation methods to prove the unique solvability of infinite horizon fully
coupled FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es and derive a set of solution estimates.
Furthermore, our results have considerable implications for a variety of
related linear quadratic (LQ) problems, especially when the stochastic
Hamiltonian system is consistent with FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es satisfying these
introduced domination-monotonicity conditions. Thus, by solving the associated
stochastic Hamiltonian system, we can derive an explicit expression for the
unique optimal control.

two types of extragradient-based methods: anchored extragradient and Nesterov's
accelerated extragradient for solving [non]linear inclusions (and, in
particular, equations), primarily under the Lipschitz continuity and the
co-hypomonotonicity assumptions. We unify and generalize a class of anchored
extragradient methods for monotone inclusions to a wider range of schemes
encompassing existing algorithms as special cases. We establish
$\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates on the residual norm of the
underlying mapping for this general framework and then specialize it to obtain
convergence guarantees for specific instances, where $k$ denotes the iteration
counter. We extend our approach to a class of anchored Tseng's
forward-backward-forward splitting methods to obtain a broader class of
algorithms for solving co-hypomonotone inclusions. Again, we analyze
$\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates for this general scheme and
specialize it to obtain convergence results for existing and new variants. We
generalize and unify Nesterov's accelerated extra-gradient method to a new
class of algorithms that covers existing schemes as special instances while
generating new variants. For these schemes, we can prove $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$
last-iterate convergence rates for the residual norm under co-hypomonotonicity,
covering a class of nonmonotone problems. We propose another novel class of
Nesterov's accelerated extragradient methods to solve inclusions.
Interestingly, these algorithms achieve both $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ and $o(1/k)$
last-iterate convergence rates, and also the convergence of iterate sequences
under co-hypomonotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we provide a set
of numerical experiments encompassing different scenarios to validate our
algorithms and theoretical guarantees.

                                        <span>  Integer programs for resource-constrained project scheduling problems are
notoriously hard to solve due to their weak linear relaxations. Several papers
have proposed reformulating project scheduling problems via Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition to strengthen their linear relaxation and decompose large problem
instances. The reformulation gives rise to a master problem that has a large
number of variables. Therefore, the master problem is solved by a column
generation procedure embedded in a branching framework, also known as
branch-and-price. While branch-and-price has been successfully applied to many
problem classes, it turns out to be ineffective for most project scheduling
problems. This paper identifies drivers of the ineffectiveness by analyzing the
structure of the reformulated problem and the strength of different branching
schemes. Our analysis shows that the reformulated problem has an unfavorable
structure for column generation: It is highly degenerate, slowing down the
convergence of column generation, and for many project scheduling problems, it
yields the same or only slightly stronger linear relaxations as classical
formulations at the expense of large increases in runtime. Our computational
experiments complement our theoretical findings.

                                        <span>  We consider to design a new efficient and easy-to-implement algorithm to
solve a general group sparse optimization model with a class of non-convex
non-Lipschitz regularizations, named as fast iterative thresholding and
support-and-scale shrinking algorithm (FITS3). In this paper we focus on the
case of a least-squares fidelity. FITS3 is designed from a lower bound theory
of such models and by integrating thresholding operation, linearization and
extrapolation techniques. The FITS3 has two advantages. Firstly, it is quite
efficient and especially suitable for large-scale problems, because it adopts
support-and-scale shrinking and does not need to solve any linear or nonlinear
system. For two important special cases, the FITS3 contains only simple
calculations like matrix-vector multiplication and soft thresholding. Secondly,
the FITS3 algorithm has a sequence convergence guarantee under proper
assumptions. The numerical experiments and comparisons to recent existing
non-Lipschitz group recovery algorithms demonstrate that, the proposed FITS3
achieves similar recovery accuracies, but costs only around a half of the CPU
time by the second fastest compared algorithm for median or large-scale
problems.

                                        <span>  LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD are widely used methods in distributed stochastic
optimization, with numerous applications in machine learning, large-scale data
processing, and federated learning. However, rigorously establishing their
theoretical advantages over simpler methods, such as minibatch SGD (MbSGD), has
proven challenging, as existing analyses often rely on strong assumptions,
unrealistic premises, or overly restrictive scenarios.
  In this work, we revisit the convergence properties of LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD
under a variety of existing or weaker conditions, including gradient
similarity, Hessian similarity, weak convexity, and Lipschitz continuity of the
Hessian. Our analysis shows that (i) LocalSGD achieves faster convergence
compared to MbSGD for weakly convex functions without requiring stronger
gradient similarity assumptions; (ii) LocalSGD benefits significantly from
higher-order similarity and smoothness; and (iii) SCAFFOLD demonstrates faster
convergence than MbSGD for a broader class of non-quadratic functions. These
theoretical insights provide a clearer understanding of the conditions under
which LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD outperform MbSGD.

                                        <span>  Data Assimilation is the process in which we improve the representation of
the state of a physical system by combining information coming from a numerical
model, real-world observations, and some prior modelling. It is widely used to
model and to improve forecast systems in Earth science fields such as
meteorology, oceanography and environmental sciences. One key aspect of Data
assimilation is the analysis step, where the output of the numerical model is
adjusted in order to account for the observational data. In Variational Data
Assimilation and under Gaussian assumptions, the analysis step comes down to
solving a high-dimensional non-linear least-square problem. In practice, this
minimization involves successive inversions of large, and possibly
ill-conditioned matrices constructed using linearizations of the forward model.
In order to improve the convergence rate of these methods, and thus reduce the
computational burden, preconditioning techniques are often used to get
better-conditioned matrices, but require either the sparsity pattern of the
matrix to inverse, or some spectral information. We propose to use Deep Neural
Networks in order to construct a preconditioner. This surrogate is trained
using some properties of the singular value decomposition, and is based on a
dataset which can be constructed online to reduce the storage requirements.

attracting the interest of mathematicians for their beautiful numerical
properties, and of statisticians for their versatility with respect to the
applications. Several penalized spline regression models are available in the
literature, and the most commonly used ones in real-world applications are
P-splines, which enjoy the advantages of penalized models while being easy to
generalize across different functional spaces and higher degree order, because
of their discrete penalty term. To face the different requirements imposed by
the nature of the problem or the physical meaning of the expected values, the
P-spline definition is often modified by additional hypotheses, often
translated into constraints on the solution or its derivatives. In this
framework, our work is motivated by the aim of getting approximation models
that fall within pre-established thresholds. Specifically, starting from a set
of observed data, we consider a P-spline constrained between some prefixed
bounds. In our paper, we just consider 0 as lower bound, although our approach
applies to more general cases. We propose to get nonnegativity by imposing
lower bounds on selected sample points. The spline can be computed through a
sequence of linearly constrained problems. We suggest a strategy to dynamically
select the sample points, to avoid extremely dense sampling, and therefore try
to reduce as much as possible the computational burden. We show through some
computational experiments the reliability of our approach and the accuracy of
the results compared to some state-of-the-art models.

box-constraints. Utilizing {\epsilon}-subdifferentials of DC components of the
objective, we develop a new method for finding global solutions to this
problem. The method combines a local search approach with a special procedure
for escaping non-global solutions by identifying improved initial points for a
local search. The method terminates when the solution cannot be improved
further. The escaping procedure is designed using subsets of the
{\epsilon}-subdifferentials of DC components. We compute the deviation between
these subsets and determine {\epsilon}-subgradients providing this deviation.
Using these specific {\epsilon}-subgradients, we formulate a subproblem with a
convex objective function. The solution to this subproblem serves as a starting
point for a local search. We study the convergence of the conceptual version of
the proposed method and discuss its implementation. A large number of academic
test problems demonstrate that the method requires reasonable computational
effort to find higher quality solutions than other local DC optimization
methods. Additionally, we apply the new method to find global solutions to DC
optimization problems and compare its performance with two benchmark global
optimization solvers.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we develop a unified machine learning (ML) approach to predict
high-quality solutions for single-machine scheduling problems with a
non-decreasing min-sum objective function with or without release times. Our ML
approach is novel in three major aspects. First, our approach is developed for
the entire class of the aforementioned problems. To achieve this, we exploit
the fact that the entire class of the problems considered can be formulated as
a time-indexed formulation in a unified manner. We develop a deep neural
network (DNN) which uses the cost parameters in the time-indexed formulation as
the inputs to effectively predict a continuous solution to this formulation,
based on which a feasible discrete solution is easily constructed. The second
novel aspect of our approach lies in how the DNN model is trained. In view of
the NP-hard nature of the problems, labels (i.e., optimal solutions) are hard
to generate for training. To overcome this difficulty, we generate and utilize
a set of special instances, for which optimal solutions can be found with
little computational effort, to train the ML model offline. The third novel
idea we employ in our approach is that we develop an online single-instance
learning approach to fine tune the parameters in the DNN for a given online
instance, with the goal of generating an improved solution for the given
instance. To this end, we develop a feasibility surrogate that approximates the
objective value of a given instance as a continuous function of the outputs of
the DNN, which then enables us to derive gradients and update the learnable
parameters in the DNN. Numerical results show that our approach can efficiently
generate high-quality solutions for a variety of single-machine scheduling
min-sum problems with up to 1000 jobs.

                                        <span>  This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous
mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater
Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in
multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs
(equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas
(equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones
with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and
the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between
transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of
SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget.
Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the
city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement
potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and
city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also
disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve
vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both
horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is
explicitly incorporated into the design objective.

                                        <span>  We consider assortment and inventory planning problems with dynamic
stockout-based substitution effects, and without replenishment, in two
different settings: (1) Customers can see all available products when they
arrive, a typical scenario in physical stores. (2) The seller can choose to
offer a subset of available products to each customer, which is more common on
online platforms. Both settings are known to be computationally challenging,
and the current approximation algorithms for the two settings are quite
different. We develop a unified algorithm framework under the MNL choice model
for both settings. Our algorithms improve on the state-of-the-art algorithms in
terms of approximation guarantee and runtime, and the ability to manage
uncertainty in the total number of customers and handle more complex
constraints. In the process, we establish various novel properties of dynamic
assortment planning (for the MNL choice model) that may be useful more broadly.

with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical
tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the
simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen

Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements
allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption
coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the
addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the
Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations
based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed idea.

                                        <span>  Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and
inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by
the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing
services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the
intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning
and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting
optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for
state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper
introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem
(JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed
Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine
learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life
constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component
is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing
problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column
generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an
attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to
cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has
been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system
of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to
the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce
high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex
instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality
compared to the existing system.

to the loss of Morse points at infinity. We find formulas for the number of
Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding 3 types of attractors when
moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.

nonlinear in probability. Our primary goal is to establish central limit
theorems for these functionals when mixed estimators are employed. Our study is
relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts
and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning methods. A
generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which
encompasses most of the known coherent risk measures including systemic
measures of risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze
vector-valued functionals, providing a framework for evaluating
high-dimensional risks. This framework facilitates the comparison of multiple
risk measures, as well as the estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic
risk and its optimal value in decision-making problems. Second, we derive novel
central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals when mixed types of
estimators: empirical and smoothed estimators are used. We provide verifiable
sufficient conditions for the central limit formulae and show their
applicability to several popular measures of risk.

                                        <span>  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to predict properties and
heuristics of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and hence accelerate MILP
solvers. This paper investigates the capacity of GNNs to represent strong
branching (SB), the most effective yet computationally expensive heuristic
employed in the branch-and-bound algorithm. In the literature, message-passing
GNN (MP-GNN), as the simplest GNN structure, is frequently used as a fast
approximation of SB and we find that not all MILPs's SB can be represented with
MP-GNN. We precisely define a class of "MP-tractable" MILPs for which MP-GNNs
can accurately approximate SB scores. Particularly, we establish a universal
approximation theorem: for any data distribution over the MP-tractable class,
there always exists an MP-GNN that can approximate the SB score with
arbitrarily high accuracy and arbitrarily high probability, which lays a
theoretical foundation of the existing works on imitating SB with MP-GNN. For
MILPs without the MP-tractability, unfortunately, a similar result is
impossible, which can be illustrated by two MILP instances with different SB
scores that cannot be distinguished by any MP-GNN, regardless of the number of
parameters. Recognizing this, we explore another GNN structure called the
second-order folklore GNN (2-FGNN) that overcomes this limitation, and the
aforementioned universal approximation theorem can be extended to the entire
MILP space using 2-FGNN, regardless of the MP-tractability. A small-scale
numerical experiment is conducted to directly validate our theoretical
findings.

                                        <span>  The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and
Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes
for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining
the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an
open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by
Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit
diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To
prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the
perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a
result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of
fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the
diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of
independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise
graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching
polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone
(circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.

                                        <span>  Green hydrogen is thought to be a game changer for reaching sustainability
targets. However, the transition to a green hydrogen economy faces a critical
challenge known as the `chicken-and-egg dilemma', wherein establishing a
hydrogen supply network relies on demand, while demand only grows with reliable
supply. In addition, as the hydrogen market is in the early stage, predicting
demand distributions is challenging due to lack of data availability. This
paper addresses these complex issues through a risk-averse framework with the
introduction of a distributionally robust hydrogen network expansion planning
problem under decision-dependent demand ambiguity. The problem optimizes
location and production capacity decisions of the suppliers considering the
moments of the stochastic hydrogen demand as a function of these investment
decisions. To obtain tractable representations of this problem, we derive two
different reformulations that consider continuous and discrete hydrogen demand
support sets under different forms of decision dependencies. To efficiently
solve the reformulations, we develop a tailored algorithm based on the
column-and-constraint generation approach, and enhance the computational
performance through solving the master problems to a relative optimality gap,
decomposing the subproblems, and integrating pre-generated columns and
constraints. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we investigate a
real case study leveraging data from the "Hydrogen Energy Applications in
Valley Environments for Northern Netherlands (HEAVENN)" project. The results
reveal that considering the chicken-and-egg dilemma under uncertain hydrogen
market conditions leads to earlier and more diverse investments, providing
critical insights for policymakers based on the degree of decision dependency.

integer coefficients over Boolean variables. The objective lies in optimizing a
linear objective function, or finding a feasible solution, or finding a
solution that satisfies as many constraints as possible. In the 2024
Pseudo-Boolean competition, solvers incorporating the SCIP framework won five
out of six categories it was competing in. From a total of 1,207 instances,
SCIP successfully solved 759, while its parallel version FiberSCIP solved 776.
Based on the results from the competition, we further enhanced SCIP's
Pseudo-Boolean capabilities. This article discusses the results and presents

chooses the size of the subspace adaptively, based on the rank of the projected
second derivative matrix. Iteratively, our variant only requires access to

and calculates a reduced step inexpensively. The ensuing method maintains the
optimal global rate of convergence of (full-dimensional) cubic regularization,
while showing improved scalability both theoretically and numerically,

our algorithm naturally adapts the subspace size to the true rank of the
function, without knowing it a priori.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a new adaptive Control Barrier Function (aCBF)
method to design the output-positive adaptive control law for a hyperbolic
PDE-ODE cascade with parametric uncertainties. This method employs the recent
adaptive control approach with batch least-squares identification (BaLSI,
pronounced "ballsy") that completes perfect parameter identification in finite
time and offers a previously unforeseen advantage in safe control design with
aCBF, which we elucidate in this paper. Since the true challenge is exhibited
for CBF of a high relative degree, we undertake a control design in this paper
for a class of systems that possess a particularly extreme relative degree:
$2\times2$ hyperbolic PDEs sandwiched by a strict-feedback nonlinear ODE and a
linear ODE, where the unknown coefficients are associated with the PDE
in-domain coupling terms and with the input signal of the distal ODE. The
designed output-positive adaptive controller guarantees the positivity of the
output signal that is the furthermost state from the control input as well as
the exponential regulation of the overall plant state to zero. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation.

                                        <span>  Off-the-grid regularisation has been extensively employed over the last
decade in the context of ill-posed inverse problems formulated in the
continuous setting of the space of Radon measures $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$.
These approaches enjoy convexity and counteract the discretisation biases as
well the numerical instabilities typical of their discrete counterparts. In the
framework of sparse reconstruction of discrete point measures (sum of weighted
Diracs), a Total Variation regularisation norm in $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$ is
typically combined with an $L^2$ data term modelling additive Gaussian noise.
To asses the framework of off-the-grid regularisation in the presence of
signal-dependent Poisson noise, we consider in this work a variational model
coupling the Total Variation regularisation with a Kullback-Leibler data term
under a non-negativity constraint. Analytically, we study the optimality
conditions of the composite functional and analyse its dual problem. Then, we
consider an homotopy strategy to select an optimal regularisation parameter and
use it within a Sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Several numerical experiments on
both 1D/2D simulated and real 3D fluorescent microscopy data are reported.

                                        <span>  This paper presents an adaptive ensemble control for stochastic systems
subject to asymmetric noises and outliers. Asymmetric noises skew system
observations, and outliers with large amplitude deteriorate the observations
even further. Such disturbances induce poor system estimation and degraded
stochastic system control. In this work, we model the asymmetric noises and
outliers by mixed asymmetric Laplace distributions (ALDs), and propose an
optimal control for stochastic systems with mixed ALD noises. Particularly, we
segregate the system disturbed by mixed ALD noises into subsystems, each of
which is subject to a specific ALD noise. For each subsystem, we design an
iterative quantile filter (IQF) to estimate the system parameters using system
observations. With the estimated parameters by IQF, we derive the certainty
equivalence (CE) control law for each subsystem. Then we use the Bayesian
approach to ensemble the subsystem CE controllers, with each of the controllers
weighted by their posterior probability. We finalize our control law as the
weighted sum of the control signals by the sub-system CE controllers. To
demonstrate our approach, we conduct numerical simulations and Monte Carlo
analyses. The results show improved tracking performance by our approach for
skew noises and its robustness to outliers, compared with single ALD based and
RLS-based control policy.

training and enhance the performance of deep neural networks, we rectify the
vanilla conjugate gradient as conjugate-gradient-like and incorporate it into
the generic Adam, and thus propose a new optimization algorithm named
CG-like-Adam for deep learning. Specifically, both the first-order and the
second-order moment estimation of generic Adam are replaced by the
conjugate-gradient-like. Convergence analysis handles the cases where the
exponential moving average coefficient of the first-order moment estimation is
constant and the first-order moment estimation is unbiased. Numerical
experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm based on the
CIFAR10/100 dataset.

studied via invariant manifold theory and symplectic geometry. The stable
manifold theory for the optimal point stabilization case is generalized to the
case of periodic orbit stabilization, where a normally hyperbolic invariant
manifold (NHIM) plays the role of a hyperbolic equilibrium.
  A sufficient condition for the existence of an NHIM of an associated
Hamiltonian system is derived in terms of a periodic Riccati differential
equation. It is shown that the problem of optimal orbit stabilization has a
solution if a linearized periodic system satisfies stabilizability and
detectability. A moving orthogonal coordinate system is employed along the
periodic orbit which is a natural framework for orbital stabilization and
linearization argument.
  Examples illustrated include an optimal control problem for a spring-mass
oscillator system, which should be stabilized at a certain energy level, and an
orbit transfer problem for a satellite, which constitutes a typical control
problem of orbital mechanics.

essential to ensure well-behavedness of the systems in the face of uncertainty.
We present Extended Linearized Contracting Dynamics (ELCD), the first neural
network-based dynamical system with global contractivity guarantees in
arbitrary metrics. The key feature of ELCD is a parametrization of the extended
linearization of the nonlinear vector field. In its most basic form, ELCD is
guaranteed to be (i) globally exponentially stable, (ii) equilibrium
contracting, and (iii) globally contracting with respect to some metric. To
allow for contraction with respect to more general metrics in the data space,
we train diffeomorphisms between the data space and a latent space and enforce
contractivity in the latent space, which ensures global contractivity in the
data space. We demonstrate the performance of ELCD on the high dimensional
LASA, multi-link pendulum, and Rosenbrock datasets.

convergence rates of the BFGS method when implemented with an inexact line
search scheme satisfying the Armijo-Wolfe conditions. We show that BFGS
achieves a global linear convergence rate of $(1 - \frac{1}{\kappa})^t$ for
$\mu$-strongly convex functions with $L$-Lipschitz gradients, where $\kappa =
\frac{L}{\mu}$ represents the condition number. Additionally, if the objective
function's Hessian is Lipschitz, BFGS with the Armijo-Wolfe line search
achieves a linear convergence rate that depends solely on the line search
parameters, independent of the condition number. We also establish a global
superlinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{1}{t})^t)$. These global
bounds are all valid for any starting point $x_0$ and any symmetric positive
definite initial Hessian approximation matrix $B_0$, though the choice of $B_0$
impacts the number of iterations needed to achieve these rates. By synthesizing
these results, we outline the first global complexity characterization of BFGS
with the Armijo-Wolfe line search. Additionally, we clearly define a mechanism
for selecting the step size to satisfy the Armijo-Wolfe conditions and
characterize its overall complexity.

                                        <span>  Autonomous robot navigation in complex environments requires robust
perception as well as high-level scene understanding due to perceptual
challenges, such as occlusions, and uncertainty introduced by robot movement.
For example, a robot climbing a cluttered staircase can misinterpret clutter as
a step, misrepresenting the state and compromising safety. This requires robust
state estimation methods capable of inferring the underlying structure of the
environment even from incomplete sensor data. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for robust state estimation of staircases. To address the
challenge of perceiving occluded staircases extending beyond the robot's
field-of-view, our approach combines an infinite-width staircase representation
with a finite endpoint state to capture the overall staircase structure. This
representation is integrated into a Bayesian inference framework to fuse noisy
measurements enabling accurate estimation of staircase location even with
partial observations and occlusions. Additionally, we present a segmentation
algorithm that works in conjunction with the staircase estimation pipeline to
accurately identify clutter-free regions on a staircase. Our method is
extensively evaluated on real robot across diverse staircases, demonstrating
significant improvements in estimation accuracy and segmentation performance
compared to baseline approaches.

                                        <span>  We present a method for teaching dexterous manipulation tasks to robots from
human hand motion demonstrations. Unlike existing approaches that solely rely
on kinematics information without taking into account the plausibility of robot
and object interaction, our method directly infers plausible robot manipulation
actions from human motion demonstrations. To address the embodiment gap between
the human hand and the robot system, our approach learns a joint motion
manifold that maps human hand movements, robot hand actions, and object
movements in 3D, enabling us to infer one motion component from others. Our key
idea is the generation of pseudo-supervision triplets, which pair human,
object, and robot motion trajectories synthetically. Through real-world
experiments with robot hand manipulation, we demonstrate that our data-driven
retargeting method significantly outperforms conventional retargeting
techniques, effectively bridging the embodiment gap between human and robotic
hands. Website at https://rureadyo.github.io/MocapRobot/.

visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding,
particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for
large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our
framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D
images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality
contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation
learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We
introduce several key innovations: i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for
detailed semantic representation, ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning
strategy to align multimodal features, iii) superpoint temporal consistency to
maintain stable representations across time, and iv) multi-source data
pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach
delivers significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in
both linear probing and fine-tuning tasks for both LiDAR-based segmentation and
object detection. Extensive experiments on eleven large-scale multi-modal
datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating the adaptability,
efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

readily available datasets for enhanced data utilization. However, existing
methods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking the
complementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work,
we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE)
paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combine
multiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points.
Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, which
transfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across different
representations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE to
adaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distills
these mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic Mixture
Supervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representations
to boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across 11
large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. The
code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have sparked interest in
their use for autonomous driving, particularly in generating interpretable
driving decisions through natural language. However, the assumption that VLMs
inherently provide visually grounded, reliable, and interpretable explanations
for driving remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce
DriveBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate VLM reliability across 17
settings (clean, corrupted, and text-only inputs), encompassing 19,200 frames,
20,498 question-answer pairs, three question types, four mainstream driving
tasks, and a total of 12 popular VLMs. Our findings reveal that VLMs often
generate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cues
rather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual
inputs. This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficient
evaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios like
autonomous driving. We further observe that VLMs struggle with multi-modal
reasoning and display heightened sensitivity to input corruptions, leading to
inconsistencies in performance. To address these challenges, we propose refined
evaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modal
understanding. Additionally, we highlight the potential of leveraging VLMs'
awareness of corruptions to enhance their reliability, offering a roadmap for
developing more trustworthy and interpretable decision-making systems in
real-world autonomous driving contexts. The benchmark toolkit is publicly
accessible.

elements such as springs and tendons in legged systems has long been recognized
for enabling energy-efficient locomotion. Yet, a significant challenge
persists: designing a robotic leg that perform consistently across diverse
operating conditions, especially varying average forward speeds. It remains
unclear whether, for such a range of operating conditions, the stiffness of the
elastic elements needs to be varied or if a similar performance can be obtained
by changing the motion and actuation while keeping the stiffness fixed. This
work explores the influence of the leg stiffness on the energy efficiency of a
monopedal robot through an extensive parametric study of its periodic hopping
motion. To this end, we formulate an optimal control problem parameterized by
average forward speed and leg stiffness, solving it numerically using direct
collocation. Our findings indicate that, compared to the use of a fixed
stiffness, employing variable stiffness in legged systems improves energy
efficiency by 20 % maximally and by 6.8 % on average across a range of speeds.

                                        <span>  The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Behavior Trees (BTs)
has recently gained attention in the robotics community, yet remains in its
early stages of development. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs
that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in
visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the
conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the
VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed
as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and
evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We
validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its
feasibility and limitations.

                                        <span>  A Multi-robot system (MRS) provides significant advantages for intricate
tasks such as environmental monitoring, underwater inspections, and space
missions. However, addressing potential communication failures or the lack of
communication infrastructure in these fields remains a challenge. A significant
portion of MRS research presumes that the system can maintain communication
with proximity constraints, but this approach does not solve situations where
communication is either non-existent, unreliable, or poses a security risk.
Some approaches tackle this issue using predictions about other robots while
not communicating, but these methods generally only permit agents to utilize
first-order reasoning, which involves reasoning based purely on their own
observations. In contrast, to deal with this problem, our proposed framework
utilizes Theory of Mind (ToM), employing higher-order reasoning by shifting a
robot's perspective to reason about a belief of others observations. Our
approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using
active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and
the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning
framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The
proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and
is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic
systems.

time. To optimize this process, simple and straightforward tests should be
excluded, focusing on challenging tests instead. This study addresses the test
selection problem for lane-keeping systems for self-driving cars. Road segment
features, such as angles and lengths, were extracted and treated as sequences,
enabling classification of the test cases as "safe" or "unsafe" using a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. The proposed model is compared against machine
learning-based test selectors. Results demonstrated that the LSTM-based method
outperformed machine learning-based methods in accuracy and precision metrics
while exhibiting comparable performance in recall and F1 scores. This work
introduces a novel deep learning-based approach to the road classification
problem, providing an effective solution for self-driving car test selection
using a simulation environment.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we present a novel synergistic framework for learning shape
estimation and a shape-aware whole-body control policy for tendon-driven
continuum robots. Our approach leverages the interaction between two Augmented
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ANODEs) -- the Shape-NODE and
Control-NODE -- to achieve continuous shape estimation and shape-aware control.
The Shape-NODE integrates prior knowledge from Cosserat rod theory, allowing it
to adapt and account for model mismatches, while the Control-NODE uses this
shape information to optimize a whole-body control policy, trained in a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. This unified framework effectively overcomes
limitations of existing data-driven methods, such as poor shape awareness and
challenges in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics. Extensive evaluations in
both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the framework's robust
performance in shape estimation, trajectory tracking, and obstacle avoidance.
The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end,
Neural-ODE, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, particularly in terms of
tracking accuracy and generalization capabilities.

                                        <span>  The development of general robotic systems capable of manipulating in
unstructured environments is a significant challenge. While Vision-Language
Models(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the
fine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks.
Fine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action
Models(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection
costs and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's
high-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our
key insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional
affordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe
interaction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as
a bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial
constraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary
robotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive
resampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level
execution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control
without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
zero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks,
highlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale
simulation data generation.

structures with varying stiffness levels, from soft tissues (low) to tendons
and cartilage (medium) to bones (high). This paper explores developing a
robotic finger with similar multi-stiffness characteristics. Specifically, we
propose using a lattice configuration, parameterized by voxel size and unit
cell geometry, to optimize and achieve fine-tuned stiffness properties with
high granularity. A significant advantage of this approach is the feasibility
of 3D printing the designs in a single process, eliminating the need for manual
assembly of elements with differing stiffness. Based on this method, we present
a novel, human-like finger, and a soft gripper. We integrate the latter with a
rigid manipulator and demonstrate the effectiveness in pick and place tasks.

                                        <span>  Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving
safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have
great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations,
leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work
introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic
motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and
yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the
incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep
learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space,
thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and
trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid
model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the
trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe
planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world
Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark
comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.

                                        <span>  Bimanual dexterous manipulation remains significant challenges in robotics
due to the high DoFs of each hand and their coordination. Existing single-hand
manipulation techniques often leverage human demonstrations to guide RL methods
but fail to generalize to complex bimanual tasks involving multiple sub-skills.
In this paper, we introduce VTAO-BiManip, a novel framework that combines
visual-tactile-action pretraining with object understanding to facilitate
curriculum RL to enable human-like bimanual manipulation. We improve prior
learning by incorporating hand motion data, providing more effective guidance
for dual-hand coordination than binary tactile feedback. Our pretraining model
predicts future actions as well as object pose and size using masked multimodal
inputs, facilitating cross-modal regularization. To address the multi-skill
learning challenge, we introduce a two-stage curriculum RL approach to
stabilize training. We evaluate our method on a bottle-cap unscrewing task,
demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments.
Our approach achieves a success rate that surpasses existing visual-tactile
pretraining methods by over 20%.

                                        <span>  One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give
attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot
strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or
the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance
trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an
accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking
method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative
collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We
propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an
auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking
module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the
tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address
conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the
near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed
environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to
the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal
invasiveness.

                                        <span>  As robot deployments become more commonplace, people are likely to take on
the role of supervising robots (i.e., correcting their mistakes) rather than
directly teaching them. Prior works on Learning from Corrections (LfC) have
relied on three key assumptions to interpret human feedback: (1) people correct
the robot only when there is significant task objective divergence; (2) people
can accurately predict if a correction is necessary; and (3) people trade off
precision and physical effort when giving corrections. In this work, we study
how two key factors (robot competency and motion legibility) affect how people
provide correction feedback and their implications on these existing
assumptions. We conduct a user study ($N=60$) under an LfC setting where
participants supervise and correct a robot performing pick-and-place tasks. We
find that people are more sensitive to suboptimal behavior by a highly
competent robot compared to an incompetent robot when the motions are legible
($p=0.0015$) and predictable ($p=0.0055$). In addition, people also tend to
withhold necessary corrections ($p < 0.0001$) when supervising an incompetent
robot and are more prone to offering unnecessary ones ($p = 0.0171$) when
supervising a highly competent robot. We also find that physical effort
positively correlates with correction precision, providing empirical evidence
to support this common assumption. We also find that this correlation is
significantly weaker for an incompetent robot with legible motions than an
incompetent robot with predictable motions ($p = 0.0075$). Our findings offer
insights for accounting for competency and legibility when designing robot
interaction behaviors and learning task objectives from corrections.

                                        <span>  Human safety is critical in applications involving close human-robot
interactions (HRI) and is a key aspect of physical compatibility between humans
and robots. While measures of human safety in HRI exist, these mainly target
industrial settings involving robotic manipulators. Less attention has been
paid to settings where mobile robots and humans share the space. This paper
introduces a new robot-centered directional framework of human safety. It is
particularly useful for evaluating mobile robots as they operate in
environments populated by multiple humans. The framework integrates several key
metrics, such as each human's relative distance, speed, and orientation. The
core novelty lies in the framework's flexibility to accommodate different
application requirements while allowing for both the robot-centered and
external observer points of view. We instantiate the framework by using RGB-D
based vision integrated with a deep learning-based human detection pipeline to
yield a generalized safety index (GSI) that instantaneously assesses human
safety. We evaluate GSI's capability of producing appropriate, robust, and
fine-grained safety measures in real-world experimental scenarios and compare
its performance with extant safety models.

mobile robotics for applications such as inspection and space exploration.
Designing underactuated rolling robots poses challenges in achieving
multi-directional propulsion with high degrees of freedom while utilizing a
limited number of actuators. This paper presents the MonoRollBot, a novel
3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) spherical robot that utilizes an underactuated
mechanism driven by only a single spring-motor system. Unlike conventional
spherical robots, MonoRollBot employs a minimalist actuation approach, relying
on only one motor and a passive spring to control its locomotion. The robot
achieves 3-DOF motion through an innovative coupling of spring dynamics and
motor control. In this work, we detail the design of the MonoRollBot and
evaluate its motion capabilities through design studies. We also do studies on
its locomotion behaviours based on changes in rotating mass and stiffness
properties.

                                        <span>  Distributed, scalable, and safe control of large-scale multi-agent systems is
a challenging problem. In this paper, we design a distributed framework for
safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a
large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local
information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of
certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on
the well-established control barrier function theory for safety guarantees and
utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of
MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an
arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework
GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a
distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is
capable of taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information,
for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with
objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target
without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments,
where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles,
increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with agents with
nonlinear dynamics (e.g., Crazyflie drones), GCBF+ outperforms the hand-crafted
CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively
small-scale MAS with up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL)
methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method
does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for
achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.

approach to teaching robots through human comparative feedback, sidestepping
the need for complex reward engineering. However, the substantial volume of
feedback required in existing PbRL methods often lead to reliance on synthetic
feedback generated by scripted teachers. This approach necessitates intricate
reward engineering again and struggles to adapt to the nuanced preferences
particular to human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios, where users may have
unique expectations toward the same task. To address these challenges, we
introduce PrefCLM, a novel framework that utilizes crowdsourced large language
models (LLMs) as simulated teachers in PbRL. We utilize Dempster-Shafer Theory
to fuse individual preferences from multiple LLM agents at the score level,
efficiently leveraging their diversity and collective intelligence. We also
introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that facilitates collective refinements
based on user interactive feedback. Experimental results across various general
RL tasks show that PrefCLM achieves competitive performance compared to
traditional scripted teachers and excels in facilitating more more natural and
efficient behaviors. A real-world user study (N=10) further demonstrates its
capability to tailor robot behaviors to individual user preferences,
significantly enhancing user satisfaction in HRI scenarios.

                                        <span>  A fundamental task in mobile robotics is keeping an intelligent agent under
surveillance with an autonomous robot as it travels in the environment. This
work studies a theoretical version of that problem involving one of the most
popular vehicle platforms in robotics. In particular, we consider two identical
Dubins cars moving on a plane without obstacles. One of them plays as the
pursuer, and it is equipped with a limited field-of-view detection region
modeled as a semi-infinite cone with its apex at the pursuer's position. The
pursuer aims to maintain the other Dubins car, which plays as the evader, as
much time as possible inside its detection region. On the contrary, the evader
wants to escape as soon as possible. In this work, employing differential game
theory, we find the time-optimal motion strategies near the game's end. The
analysis of those trajectories reveals the existence of at least two singular
surfaces: a Transition Surface (also known as a Switch Surface) and an Evader's
Universal Surface. We also found that the barrier's standard construction
produces a surface that partially lies outside the playing space.

tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings.
However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for
improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their
efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA
({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation
Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of
models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor,
pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for
collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that
provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike
planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and
replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark
several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular
approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning.
Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging
pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the
neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data
efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based
MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for
evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household
robotics tasks.

                                        <span>  Continuous-time batch state estimation using Gaussian processes is an
efficient approach to estimate the trajectories of robots over time. In the
past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such
approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This
paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as
velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process
state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across
different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of
continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and the estimation of
quasi-static continuum robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control
inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements
and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach
particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available. For
example, in a mobile robot localization experiment with sparse landmark
distance measurements and frequent odometry control inputs, our approach
provides accurate trajectory estimates with root-mean-square errors around 3-4
cm and 4-5 degrees, even with time intervals up to five seconds between
discrete estimation nodes, which significantly reduces computation time.

expertise in programming to transfer skills to robots in a user-friendly
manner, since it mirrors how humans learn new behaviors by observing others.
Many existing methods focus on instructing robots to mimic human trajectories,
but motion-level strategies often pose challenges in skills generalization
across diverse environments. This paper proposes a novel framework that allows
robots to achieve a higher-level understanding of human-demonstrated manual
tasks recorded in RGB videos. By recognizing the task structure and goals,
robots generalize what observed to unseen scenarios. We found our task
representation on Shannon's Information Theory (IT), which is applied for the
first time to manual tasks. IT helps extract the active scene elements and
quantify the information shared between hands and objects. We exploit scene
graph properties to encode the extracted interaction features in a compact
structure and segment the demonstration into blocks, streamlining the
generation of Behavior Trees for robot replicas. Experiments validated the
effectiveness of IT to automatically generate robot execution plans from a
single human demonstration. Additionally, we provide HANDSOME, an open-source
dataset of HAND Skills demOnstrated by Multi-subjEcts, to promote further
research and evaluation in this field.

principles emerged to improve mobility on challenging terrains. This paper
presents the application of the MuJoCo physics engine to realize a digital twin
of an adaptive soft foot developed for use with legged robots. We release the
MuJoCo soft foot digital twin as open source to allow users and researchers to
explore new approaches to locomotion. The work includes the system modeling
techniques along with the kinematic and dynamic attributes involved. Validation
is conducted through a rigorous comparison with bench tests on a physical
prototype, replicating these experiments in simulation. Results are evaluated
based on sole deformation and contact forces during foot-obstacle interaction.
The foot model is subsequently integrated into simulations of the humanoid
robot COMAN+, replacing its original flat feet. Results show an improvement in
the robot's ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control
strategy. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive modeling approach for
adaptive soft feet, supported by qualitative comparisons of bipedal locomotion
with state of the art robotic feet.

                                        <span>  Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and
minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear
process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This
study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear
prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process,
relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits
generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often
impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this
research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal
training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple
setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation
approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via
transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models,
including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks
(LSTM), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, trained on different
input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT).
The performance of the models is evaluated on different amounts of training
data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing
insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results
demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective
tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and
efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt
model has an exceptional performance, achieving an 99.1% accuracy in
identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until
they are worn.

devices, such as 2D devices, is helpful to control the robots anytime and
anywhere as intended. Hand-drawn sketches are one of the intuitive ways to
control robots with 2D devices. However, since similar sketches have different
intentions from scene to scene, existing work needs additional modalities to
set the sketches' semantics. This requires complex operations for users and
leads to decreasing usability. In this paper, we propose Sketch-MoMa, a
teleoperation system using the user-given hand-drawn sketches as instructions
to control a robot. We use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the
user-given sketches superimposed on an observation image and infer drawn shapes
and low-level tasks of the robot. We utilize the sketches and the generated
shapes for recognition and motion planning of the generated low-level tasks for
precise and intuitive operations. We validate our approach using
state-of-the-art VLMs with 7 tasks and 5 sketch shapes. We also demonstrate
that our approach effectively specifies the detailed motions, such as how to
grasp and how much to rotate. Moreover, we show the competitive usability of
our approach compared with the existing 2D interface through a user experiment
with 14 participants.

ORGANA interacts with chemists using Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive
experiment goals, handle disambiguation, and provide experiment logs. ORGANA
plans and executes complex tasks with visual feedback, while supporting
scheduling and parallel task execution. We demonstrate ORGANA's capabilities in
solubility, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry
experiments. In electrochemistry, it executes a 19-step plan in parallel to
characterize quinone derivatives for flow batteries. Our user study shows
ORGANA reduces frustration and physical demand by over 50%, with users saving
an average of 80.3% of their time when using it.

                                        <span>  Control theory plays a pivotal role in understanding and optimizing the
behavior of complex dynamical systems across various scientific and engineering
disciplines. Two key frameworks that have emerged for modeling and solving
control problems in stochastic systems are piecewise deterministic Markov
processes (PDMPs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Each framework has its
unique strengths, and their intersection offers promising opportunities for
tackling a broad class of problems, particularly in the context of impulse
controls and decision-making in complex systems.
  The relationship between PDMPs and MDPs is a natural subject of exploration,
as embedding impulse control problems for PDMPs into the MDP framework could
open new avenues for their analysis and resolution. Specifically, this
integration would allow leveraging the computational and theoretical tools
developed for MDPs to address the challenges inherent in PDMPs. On the other
hand, PDMPs can offer a versatile and simple paradigm to model continuous time
problems that are often described as discrete-time MDPs parametrized by complex
transition kernels. This transformation has the potential to bridge the gap
between the two frameworks, enabling solutions to previously intractable
problems and expanding the scope of both fields. This paper presents a
comprehensive review of two research domains, illustrated through a recurring
medical example. The example is revisited and progressively formalized within
the framework of thevarious concepts and objects introduced

imperative to examine the security vulnerabilities within these cyber-physical
systems. While conventional cyber-security concerns are often at the forefront
of discussions, it is essential to get deeper into the various layers of

is to spotlight imminent challenges faced by AV operators and explore emerging
technologies for comprehensive solutions. This research outlines the diverse

solutions for each potential attack vector, ensuring that autonomous vehicles

                                        <span>  Robust stability of moving-horizon estimators is investigated for nonlinear
discrete-time systems that are detectable in the sense of incremental
input/output-to-state stability and are affected by disturbances. The estimate
of a moving-horizon estimator stems from the on-line solution of a
least-squares minimization problem at each time instant. The resulting
stability guarantees depend on the optimization tolerance in solving such
minimization problems. Specifically, two main contributions are established:
(i) the robust stability of the estimation error, while supposing to solve
exactly the on-line minimization problem; (ii) the practical robust stability
of the estimation error with state estimates obtained by an imperfect
minimization. Finally, the construction of such robust moving-horizon
estimators and the performances resulting from the design based on the
theoretical findings are showcased with two numerical examples.

potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and
curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably,
among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently
encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using
signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid
architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the
training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking
overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This
paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults
by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for
diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration
signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with
47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2
model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as
accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the
visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also
provides insights into the training and testing times for each model,
contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis
methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the
performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation
for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in
industrial settings.

imitation model predictive controllers utilizing neural networks. Leveraging
the Lipschitz properties of these neural networks, we derive a bound that
guides dataset design to ensure the approximation error remains at chosen
limits. We discuss how this method can be used to design a stable neural
network controller with performance guarantees employing existing robust model
predictive control approaches for data generation. Additionally, we introduce a
training adjustment, which is based on the sensitivities of the optimization
problem and reduces dataset density requirements based on the derived bounds.
We verify that the proposed augmentation results in improvements to the
network's predictive capabilities and a reduction of the Lipschitz constant.
Moreover, on a simulated inverted pendulum problem, we show that the approach
results in a closer match of the closed-loop behavior between the imitation and
the original model predictive controller.

the latter is constrained by the mechanical impact. The system dynamics is
described by the previously introduced modeling frameworks of force transition
and dissipation through the nonlinear Coulomb friction and structural damping,
the later in accord with Hertzian contact theory. The focus of the recent study
is on combining both interaction mechanisms, and the detailed experimental
evaluation which discloses validity of the modeling assumptions. Such

                                        <span>  This paper demonstrates real-time short-term traffic flow prediction through
distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) and data assimilation with a stochastic
cell-automata-based traffic model. Traffic congestion on expressways is a
severe issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize
traffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time
short-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic
monitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to
the sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing
real-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain
spatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without
dead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature
extraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the
short-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic
Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is
simulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed
mean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic
traffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios
obtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error
of the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30
minutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time
decreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with
conventional methods with traffic counters. This paper concludes that real-time
data assimilation using DFOS enables an accurate short-term traffic prediction.

communication networks will enable global coverage in space, air, ground, and
sea. In this case, both base stations and users can be mobile and will tend to
move continuously in three-dimensional (3D) space. Therefore, obtaining channel
state information (CSI) in 3D continuous-space is crucial for the design and
performance evaluation of future 6G and B6G wireless systems. On the other
hand, new 6G technologies such as integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
will also require prior knowledge of CSI in 3D continuous-space. In this paper,
a 3D continuous-space electromagnetic channel model is proposed for
tri-polarized multi-user communications, taking into account scatterers and
spherical wavefronts. Scattered fields are calculated using the method of
moments (MoM) with high accuracy. Spherical wave functions are utilized to
decompose the dyadic Green's functions that connect the transmitted source
currents and the received electric fields. Simulation results demonstrate that
transmit power, apertures, scatterers, and sample intervals have significant
impacts on statistical properties and channel capacities, providing insights
into the performance of continuous-space electromagnetic channel models and the
design of future wireless systems.

potential for realizing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this
paper, both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and polarized Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel measurements are conducted in an IIoT scenario
at the less congested Wi-Fi band, i.e., 5.5~GHz. The purpose is to investigate
wireless characteristics of communications between access points and terminals
mounted on automated guided vehicles as well as those surrounding manufacturing
areas. For SISO channel measurements, statistical properties including the
delay Power Spectral Density (PSD), path loss, shadowing fading, delay spread,
excess delay, K-factor, and amplitude distribution of small-scale fading are
analyzed and compared with those observed in an office scenario. For MIMO
channel measurements, results show that there are multiple Dense Multipath
Component (DMC) processes in the delay PSD. An estimation algorithm based on
the algorithm for a single DMC process is proposed to effectively process the
multi-processes data. Moreover, delay, angular, power, and polarization
properties of DMCs are investigated and compared with those of specular
multipath components. Furthermore, effects of DMCs on Singular Values (SVs) and
channel capacities are explored. Ignoring DMCs can overestimate SVs and
underestimate channel capacities.

that integrates barrier-based and Lyapunov-based safety-critical control
strategies for strict-feedback systems with potentially unknown dynamics. The
proposed method employs a modular design procedure, decomposing the original
system into a proxy subsystem and a virtual tracking subsystem that are
controlled by the control barrier function (CBF)-based and Lyapunov-based
controllers, respectively. By integrating these separately designed
controllers, the overall system's safety is ensured. Moreover, a new
filter-based disturbance observer is utilized to design a PCBF-based safe
controller for strict-feedback systems subject to mismatched disturbances. This
approach broadens the class of systems to which CBF-based methods can be
applied and significantly simplifies CBF construction by requiring only the
model of the proxy subsystem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through numerical simulations.

critical for the control of large-scale power systems under uncertainty. The
chance-constrained OPF (CCOPF) problem provides a natural formulation of the
trade-off between the operating cost and the constraint satisfaction rate. In
this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the CCOPF problem, based
on distributionally robust optimization (DRO). \revise{We show that the
proposed reformulation of the distributionally robust chance constraints is
exact, whereas other approaches in the CCOPF literature rely on conservative
approximations. We establish out-of-sample robustness guarantees for the
distributionally robust solution and prove that the solution is the most
efficient among all approaches enjoying the same guarantees.} We apply the
proposed algorithm to the the CCOPF problem and compare the performance of our
approach with existing methods using simulations on IEEE benchmark power

interconnected systems possibly affected by network anomalies. In the framework
of adaptive approximation, the distributed controller and parameter estimator
are designed by exploiting a backstepping approach. The stability of the
distributed control system under anomalies is analyzed, where both local and
neighboring anomaly effects are considered. To quantify the resilience of the
interconnected system under the action of network anomalies, we derive bounds
on the duration of each anomaly and the resting time between two consecutive
anomalies. Specifically, when each anomaly duration is smaller than our
designed upper bound, the interconnected system controlled by the distributed
approximation-based controller remains asymptotically stable. Moreover, if the
resting time between two consecutive anomalies is larger than the proposed
bound, then all signals of the control system are guaranteed to be bounded. In
the paper, we show that under the action of the proposed distributed adaptive
controller, the interconnected system remains stable in the presence of network
anomalies, with both the qualitative and quantitative resilient conditions.
Extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a unified detection strategy against three kinds of
attacks for multi-agent systems (MASs) which is applicable to both transient
and steady stages. For attacks on the communication layer, a watermarking-based
detection scheme with KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence is designed. Different
from traditional communication schemes, each agent transmits a message set
containing two state values with different types of watermarking. It is found
that the detection performance is determined by the relevant parameters of the
watermarking signal. Unlike the existing detection manoeuvres, such a scheme is
capable of transient and steady stages. For attacks on the agent layer, a
convergence rate related detection approach is put forward. It is shown that
the resilience of the considered system is characterized by the coefficient and
offset of the envelope. For hybrid attacks, based on the above detection
mechanisms, a general framework resorting to trusted agents is presented, which
requires weaker graph conditions and less information transmission. Finally, an
example associated with the platooning of connected vehicles is given to
support the theoretical results.

                                        <span>  LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks,
enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent
advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely
unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa
network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability
and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This
work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to
disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a
LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access
point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public
Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which
devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data
handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation
validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06
kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B.
Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource
utilization on the ICN was minimal.

confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are
similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics
literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs
in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and
pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors
gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link
dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively
low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector
localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon
are briefly discussed.

                                        <span>  Large Language Model (LLM) workloads have distinct prefill and decode phases
with different compute and memory requirements which should ideally be
accounted for when scheduling input queries across different LLM instances in a
cluster. However existing scheduling algorithms treat LLM workloads as
monolithic jobs without considering the distinct characteristics of the two
phases in each workload. This leads to sub-optimal scheduling and increased
response latency. In this work, we start by characterizing factors affecting
the response latency during LLM inference serving. We establish that better
load balancing of inference requests across the available LLM instances can
improve the end-to-end latency to a larger extent than merely focusing on
optimizing the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by our findings, we propose
a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for
data-driven and workload-aware scheduling. Our router schedules queries across
LLM instances by leveraging a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel
formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads and
achieves over 11% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches on a mix of
public datasets and 7.8% lower end-to-end latency on real workload data with
diverse input and output trends from Cloud Provider X. Additionally, the
proposed framework can also serve as a standard for benchmarking different LLM
inference schedulers since it provides the best latency for a given model,
hardware, and instance-level scheduler combination.

with the aim of providing a distributed solution for multi-agent systems with
second-order integrator dynamics. In the literature, most of the results
related to multi-agent formation tracking do not consider energy issues while
investigating distributed feedback control laws. In order to account for this
crucial design aspect, we contribute by formalizing and proposing a solution to
an optimization problem that encapsulates trajectory tracking, distance-based
formation control and input energy minimization, through a specific and key
choice of potential functions in the optimization cost. To this end, we show
how to compute the inverse dynamics in a centralized fashion by means of the
Projector-Operator-based Newton's method for Trajectory Optimization (PRONTO)
and, more importantly, we exploit such an offline solution as a general
reference to devise a stabilizing online distributed control law. Finally,
numerical examples involving a cubic formation following a chicane-like path in
the 3D space are provided to validate the proposed control strategies.

                                        <span>  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method for complex system
regulation, but its reliance on an accurate model poses many limitations in
real-world applications. Data-driven predictive control (DDPC) aims at
overcoming this limitation, by relying on historical data to provide
information on the plant to be controlled. In this work, we present a unified
stochastic framework for direct DDPC, where control actions are obtained by
optimizing the Final Control Error (FCE), which is directly computed from
available data only and automatically weighs the impact of uncertainty on the
control objective. Our framework allows us to establish a separation principle
for Predictive Control, elucidating the role that predictive models and their
uncertainty play in DDPC. Moreover, it generalizes existing DDPC methods, like
regularized Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and $\gamma$-DDPC,
providing a path toward noise-tolerant data-based control with rigorous
optimality guarantees. The theoretical investigation is complemented by a
series of experiments (code available on GitHub:
https://github.com/marcofabris92/a-separation-principle-in-d3pc), revealing
that the proposed method consistently outperforms or, at worst, matches
existing techniques without requiring tuning regularization parameters as other
methods do.

                                        <span>  Modern network systems, such as transportation and communication systems, are
prone to cyber-physical disruptions and thus suffer efficiency loss. This paper
studies network resiliency, in terms of throughput, and develops resilient
control to improve throughput. We consider single-commodity networks that admit
congestion propagation. We also apply a Markov process to model disruption
switches. For throughput analysis, we first use insights into congestion
spillback to propose novel Lyapunov functions and then exploit monotone network
dynamics to reduce computational costs of verifying stability conditions. For
control design, we show that (i) for a network with infinite link storage
space, there exists an open-loop control that attains the min-expected-cut
capacity; (ii) for a network with observable disruptions that restrict maximum
sending and/or receiving flows, there exists a mode-dependent control that
attains the expected-min-cut capacity; (iii) for general networks, there exists
a closed-loop control with throughput guarantees. We also derive lower bounds
of resiliency scores for a set of numerical examples and verify resiliency
improvement with our method.

                                        <span>  In recent years, artificial feet based on soft robotics and under-actuation
principles emerged to improve mobility on challenging terrains. This paper
presents the application of the MuJoCo physics engine to realize a digital twin
of an adaptive soft foot developed for use with legged robots. We release the
MuJoCo soft foot digital twin as open source to allow users and researchers to
explore new approaches to locomotion. The work includes the system modeling
techniques along with the kinematic and dynamic attributes involved. Validation
is conducted through a rigorous comparison with bench tests on a physical
prototype, replicating these experiments in simulation. Results are evaluated
based on sole deformation and contact forces during foot-obstacle interaction.
The foot model is subsequently integrated into simulations of the humanoid
robot COMAN+, replacing its original flat feet. Results show an improvement in
the robot's ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control
strategy. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive modeling approach for
adaptive soft feet, supported by qualitative comparisons of bipedal locomotion
with state of the art robotic feet.

                                        <span>  Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely
used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches
are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges.
In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy
in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic
system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the
public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to
infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference
attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and
quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its
uncertainty sets. For linear scalar systems, we derive an explicit formulation
of the uncertainty set. For multi-dimensional linear systems, we develop an
approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis. We investigate the
properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it
is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set.
Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter
using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy
measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated
through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against
the inference attack.

                                        <span>  Advances in software and hardware technologies have facilitated the
production of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Nowadays, people
actively use quadrotor UAVs in essential missions such as search and rescue,
counter-terrorism, firefighting, surveillance, and cargo transportation. While
performing these tasks, quadrotors must operate in noisy environments.
Therefore, a robust controller design that can control the altitude and
attitude of the quadrotor in noisy environments is of great importance. Many
researchers have focused only on white Gaussian noise in their studies, whereas
researchers need to consider the effects of all colored noises during the
operation of the quadrotor. This study aims to design a robust controller that
is resistant to all colored noises. Firstly, a nonlinear quadrotor model was
created with MATLAB. Then, a backstepping controller resistant to colored
noises was designed. The designed backstepping controller was tested under
Gaussian white, pink, brown, blue, and purple noises. PID and Lyapunov-based
controller designs were also carried out, and their time responses (rise time,
overshoot, settling time) were compared with those of the backstepping
controller. In the simulations, time was in seconds, altitude was in meters,
and roll, pitch, and yaw references were in radians. Rise and settling time
values were in seconds, and overshoot value was in percent. When the obtained
values are examined, simulations prove that the proposed backstepping
controller has the least overshoot and the shortest settling time under all
noise types.

asymptotic active fault diagnosis, which is based on a newly-defined notion
named the excluding degree of the origin from a zonotope. Using the excluding
degree, a quantitative specification is obtained to characterize the
performance of set-based robust fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a single gain
design method and a joint gain and input design method are proposed,
respectively. This is the first work to achieve a joint observer gain and input
design for set-based active fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods
that design gains and input separately, the proposed joint gain and input
design method has advantages to exploit the fault diagnosis potential of
observer-based schemes. Finally, several examples are used to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

                                        <span>  This study aims to optimize meal planning for nutritional health and cost
efficiency using linear programming. Linear optimization provides an effective
framework for addressing the problem of an optimal diet, as the composition of
food can be naturally modeled as a linearly additive system. Leveraging a
comprehensive nutrition dataset, our model minimizes meal costs while meeting
specific nutritional requirements. We explore additional complexities, such as
fractional weights and nutrient ratio constraints, enhancing the robustness of
the solution. Case studies address common nutritional challenges, providing
tailored diet plans. The significance lies in aiding individuals to form
balanced, cost-effective dietary schedules, considering fitness goals and
caloric needs. This research contributes to efficient, sustainable, and
time-sensitive meal planning, emphasizing the intersection of nutrition,
optimization, and real-world applicability.

                                        <span>  We study the mixing time of the projected Langevin algorithm (LA) and the
privacy curve of noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), beyond nonexpansive
iterations. Specifically, we derive new mixing time bounds for the projected LA
which are, in some important cases, dimension-free and poly-logarithmic on the
accuracy, closely matching the existing results in the smooth convex case.
Additionally, we establish new upper bounds for the privacy curve of the
subsampled noisy SGD algorithm. These bounds show a crucial dependency on the
regularity of gradients, and are useful for a wide range of convex losses
beyond the smooth case. Our analysis relies on a suitable extension of the
Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI) framework (Feldman et al., 2018;
Altschuler and Talwar, 2022, 2023) to noisy iterations whose gradient map is
not necessarily nonexpansive. This extension is achieved by designing an
optimization problem which accounts for the best possible R\'enyi divergence
bound obtained by an application of PABI, where the tractability of the problem
is crucially related to the modulus of continuity of the associated gradient
mapping. We show that, in several interesting cases -- including the nonsmooth
convex, weakly smooth and (strongly) dissipative -- such optimization problem
can be solved exactly and explicitly. This yields the tightest possible
PABI-based bounds, where our results are either new or substantially sharper
than those in previous works.

and forecasting of the vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a marine riser, using
field data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepVIVONet in accurately
reconstructing the motion of an off--shore marine riser by using sparse
spatio-temporal measurements. We also show the generalization of our model in
extrapolating to other flow conditions via transfer learning, underscoring its
potential to streamline operational efficiency and enhance predictive accuracy.
The trained DeepVIVONet serves as a fast and accurate surrogate model for the
marine riser, which we use in an outer--loop optimization algorithm to obtain
the optimal locations for placing the sensors. Furthermore, we employ an
existing sensor placement method based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
to compare with our data-driven approach. We find that that while POD offers a
good approach for initial sensor placement, DeepVIVONet's adaptive capabilities
yield more precise and cost-effective configurations.

                                        <span>  Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) are ubiquitous in
optimization: Such problems arise in applications from operations research,
power systems, signal processing, chemical engineering, portfolio theory, among
others. Despite their flexibility in modeling real-life situations and the
recent effort to understand their properties, nonconvex QCQPs are hard to solve
in practice. Most of the approaches in the literature are based on either
Linear Programming (LP) or Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxations, each of
which works very well for some problem subclasses but perform poorly on others.
In this paper, we develop a relaxation selection procedure for nonconvex QCQPs
that can adaptively decide whether an LP- or SDP-based approach is expected to
be more beneficial by considering the instance structure. The proposed
methodology relies on utilizing machine learning methods that involve features
derived from spectral properties and sparsity patterns of data matrices, and
once trained appropriately, the prediction model is applicable to any instance
with an arbitrary number of variables and constraints. We train and test
classification and regression models over synthetically generated instances,
and empirically show the efficacy of our approach.

                                        <span>  Numerical stabilization techniques are often employed in under-resolved
simulations of convection-dominated flows to improve accuracy and mitigate
spurious oscillations. Specifically, the Evolve-Filter-Relax (EFR) algorithm is
a framework which consists in evolving the solution, applying a filtering step
to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of
filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution
strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\delta$ and the
relaxation parameter $\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually
fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size
for $\delta$ and the time step for $\chi$. This paper makes two significant
improvements to the standard EFR framework by proposing: (i) time-dependent
parameters, (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time,
considering a fully-resolved simulation as a reference. In particular, we
propose three different classes of Optimized-EFR strategies, aiming to optimize
one or both parameters. Moreover, we investigate the accuracy and efficiency of
the proposed optimization algorithms considering different objective functions,
both local (point-valued) and global (such as the kinetic energy). The new
Optimized-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a
turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$. The new Optimized-EFR results are
more accurate than the standard EFR solution while maintaining a similar
computational time. In particular, we show that using a global objective
function and including the $H^1$ velocity seminorm is crucial to accurately
match the reference flow dynamics.

summability assumptions already appear in the literature. However, we show that
the weakest compactness conditions that can be derived are already enough to
obtain the convergence of the regularized functionals. This approach allows us
to characterize the variational limit of the regularization even when it does
not converge to the original problem. The results apply also to problems with
more than two marginals.

ground state of a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation with Neumann boundary
conditions. We prove that, when the linearized system is not controllable, the
nonlinear system is not controllable, due to a quadratic obstruction involving
the squared norm of the control's primitive. This obstruction has been known
since 1983 for ODEs and observed for some PDEs since 2006. However, our
situation is more intricate since the kernel describing the quadratic expansion
of the solution is not twice differentiable. We thus follow a Fourier-based
approach, closer to the one used for quadratic obstructions of fractional
Sobolev regularity.
  In this Fourier-based approach, a challenge is to formulate a necessary and
sufficient condition on the convolution kernel, for the quadratic form to be
coercive. In previous studies, the coercivity was ensured by a signed
asymptotic equivalent for the Fourier transform of the convolution kernel of
the form $\widehat{K}(\omega) \sim \omega^{-2}$ as $|\omega| \to \infty$. In
our case, $\widehat{K}$ is a distribution which has singularities and changes
sign up to infinity. We still prove coercivity because one of the signs appears
too infrequently.

Fokker-Planck equation which arises as the mean field limit of an interacting
particle systems that is subject to distance dependent random fluctuations is
studied. As the equation of interest is only hypocoercive and the control
operator is unbounded with respect to the canonical state space, classical
variational solution techniques cannot be utilized directly. Instead, the
concept of admissible control operators is employed. For the underlying
nonlinearities, local Lipschitz estimates are derived and subsequently used
within a fixed point argument to obtain local existence of solutions. Again,
due to hypocoercivity, existence of optimal controls requires non standard
techniques as (compensated) compactness arguments are not readily available.

                                        <span>  In recent years, copositive programming has received significant attention
for its ability to model hard problems in both discrete and continuous
optimization. Several relaxations of copositive programs based on semidefinite
programming (SDP) have been proposed in the literature, meant to provide
tractable bounds. However, while these SDP-based relaxations are amenable to
the ellipsoid algorithm and interior point methods, it is not immediately
obvious that they can be solved in polynomial time (even approximately). In
this paper, we consider the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies of relaxations for
copositive programs introduced by Parrilo (2000), de Klerk & Pasechnik (2002)
and Pe\~na, Vera & Zuluaga (2006), which can be formulated as SDPs. We
establish sufficient conditions that guarantee the polynomial-time
computability (up to fixed precision) of these relaxations. These conditions
are satisfied by copositive programs that represent standard quadratic programs
and their reciprocals. As an application, we show that the SOS bounds for the
(weighted) stability number of a graph can be computed efficiently.
Additionally, we provide pathological examples of copositive programs (that do
not satisfy the sufficient conditions) whose SOS relaxations admit only
feasible solutions of doubly-exponential size.

type of Markov decision process that models sequential decision-making problems
which are not only characterized by temporal, but also by spatial interaction
structures. To illustrate the framework, we construct an STMDP inspired by the
low-temperature two-dimensional Ising model on a finite, square lattice,
evolving according to the Metropolis dynamics. We consider the situation in
which an external decision maker aims to drive the system towards the all-plus
configuration by flipping spins at specified moments in time. In order to
analyze this problem, we construct an auxiliary MDP by means of a reduction of
the configuration space to the local minima of the Hamiltonian. Leveraging the
convenient form of this auxiliary MDP, we uncover the structure of the optimal
policy by solving the Bellman equations in a recursive manner. Finally, we
conduct a numerical study on the performance of the optimal policy obtained
from the auxiliary MDP in the original Ising STMDP.

that integrates barrier-based and Lyapunov-based safety-critical control
strategies for strict-feedback systems with potentially unknown dynamics. The
proposed method employs a modular design procedure, decomposing the original
system into a proxy subsystem and a virtual tracking subsystem that are
controlled by the control barrier function (CBF)-based and Lyapunov-based
controllers, respectively. By integrating these separately designed
controllers, the overall system's safety is ensured. Moreover, a new
filter-based disturbance observer is utilized to design a PCBF-based safe
controller for strict-feedback systems subject to mismatched disturbances. This
approach broadens the class of systems to which CBF-based methods can be
applied and significantly simplifies CBF construction by requiring only the
model of the proxy subsystem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through numerical simulations.

critical for the control of large-scale power systems under uncertainty. The
chance-constrained OPF (CCOPF) problem provides a natural formulation of the
trade-off between the operating cost and the constraint satisfaction rate. In
this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the CCOPF problem, based
on distributionally robust optimization (DRO). \revise{We show that the
proposed reformulation of the distributionally robust chance constraints is
exact, whereas other approaches in the CCOPF literature rely on conservative
approximations. We establish out-of-sample robustness guarantees for the
distributionally robust solution and prove that the solution is the most
efficient among all approaches enjoying the same guarantees.} We apply the
proposed algorithm to the the CCOPF problem and compare the performance of our
approach with existing methods using simulations on IEEE benchmark power
systems.

                                        <span>  Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing
potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering
skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface
corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the
governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of
rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the
eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to
effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify
the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce
established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility
and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a
domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation
analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain
transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate
boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes
at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the
dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully
predicts drag reduction trends for semi-circular riblets, consistent with
existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow
mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with
friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of
Kelvin-Helmholtz rollers over large and sharp semi-circular riblets,
contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries.
Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures,
focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over
large riblets.

polynomial matrix inequality constraints with universal quantifiers. We first
present a Scherer-Hol-type Positivstellensatz under the Archimedean condition.
When the objective is a scalar polynomial, we further provide a sparse
Scherer-Hol-type Positivstellensatz in the presence of correlative sparsity.
Next, without assuming the Archimedean condition, we derive
Putinar-Vasilescu-type, P\'olya-type, and Lasserre-Netzer-type
Positivstellens\"atze under the same setting. These results can be viewed as
common generalizations of corresponding Positivstellens\"atze in the cases of
polynomials, polynomials with universal quantifiers, and polynomial matrices.
For the proofs, techniques from *-algebra, real algebraic geometry, operator
theory, and convex optimization are employed. Applications of the established
Positivstellens\"atze to robust polynomial matrix optimization are also
discussed.

to design optimization proxies that learn the input/output mapping of
parametric optimization problems. These optimization proxies are trustworthy by
design: they compute feasible solutions to the underlying optimization
problems, provide quality guarantees on the returned solutions, and scale to
large instances. Optimization proxies are differentiable programs that combine
traditional deep learning technology with repair or completion layers to
produce feasible solutions. The article shows that optimization proxies can be
trained end-to-end in a self-supervised way. It presents methodologies to
provide performance guarantees and to scale optimization proxies to large-scale
optimization problems. The potential of optimization proxies is highlighted
through applications in power systems and, in particular, real-time risk
assessment and security-constrained optimal power flow.

                                        <span>  Distributed, scalable, and safe control of large-scale multi-agent systems is
a challenging problem. In this paper, we design a distributed framework for
safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a
large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local
information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of
certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on
the well-established control barrier function theory for safety guarantees and
utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of
MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an
arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework
GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a
distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is
capable of taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information,
for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with
objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target
without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments,
where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles,
increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with agents with
nonlinear dynamics (e.g., Crazyflie drones), GCBF+ outperforms the hand-crafted
CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively
small-scale MAS with up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL)
methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method
does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for
achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.

                                        <span>  Bayesian hierarchical models can provide efficient algorithms for finding
sparse solutions to ill-posed inverse problems. The models typically comprise a
conditionally Gaussian prior model for the unknown which is augmented by a
generalized gamma hyper-prior model for variance hyper-parameters. This
investigation generalizes these models and their efficient maximum a posterior
(MAP) estimation using the iterative alternating sequential (IAS) algorithm in
two ways: (1) General sparsifying transforms: Diverging from conventional
methods, our approach permits the use of sparsifying transformations with
nontrivial kernels; (2) Unknown noise variances: We treat the noise variance as
a random variable that is estimated during the inference procedure. This is
important in applications where the noise estimate cannot be accurately
estimated a priori. Remarkably, these augmentations neither significantly
burden the computational expense of the algorithm nor compromise its efficacy.
We include convexity and convergence analysis for the method and demonstrate
its efficacy in several numerical experiments.

explore a structured class of non-monotone problems that exhibit weak Minty

                                        <span>  A fundamental task in mobile robotics is keeping an intelligent agent under
surveillance with an autonomous robot as it travels in the environment. This
work studies a theoretical version of that problem involving one of the most
popular vehicle platforms in robotics. In particular, we consider two identical
Dubins cars moving on a plane without obstacles. One of them plays as the
pursuer, and it is equipped with a limited field-of-view detection region
modeled as a semi-infinite cone with its apex at the pursuer's position. The
pursuer aims to maintain the other Dubins car, which plays as the evader, as
much time as possible inside its detection region. On the contrary, the evader
wants to escape as soon as possible. In this work, employing differential game
theory, we find the time-optimal motion strategies near the game's end. The
analysis of those trajectories reveals the existence of at least two singular
surfaces: a Transition Surface (also known as a Switch Surface) and an Evader's
Universal Surface. We also found that the barrier's standard construction
produces a surface that partially lies outside the playing space.

process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen
widespread use, but there have not been many theoretically-sound methods for
improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward
fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a
very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in
order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the
generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which
outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression
problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods
for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and
generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample
diversity.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we study the Aubin property of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution
mapping for the nonlinear semidefinite programming (NLSDP) problem at a locally
optimal solution. In the literature, it is known that the Aubin property
implies the constraint nondegeneracy by Fusek [SIAM J. Optim. 23 (2013), pp.
1041-1061] and the second-order sufficient condition by Ding et al. [SIAM J.
Optim. 27 (2017), pp. 67-90]. Based on the Mordukhovich criterion, here we
further prove that the strong second-order sufficient condition is also
necessary for the Aubin property to hold. Consequently, several equivalent
conditions including the strong regularity are established for NLSDP's Aubin
property. Together with the recent progress made by Chen et al. on the
equivalence between the Aubin property and the strong regularity for nonlinear
second-order cone programming [SIAM J. Optim., in press; arXiv:2406.13798v3
(2024)], this paper constitutes a significant step forward in characterizing
the Aubin property for general non-polyhedral $C^2$-cone reducible constrained
optimization problems.

known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical
constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions.
This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can
constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata
such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints,
such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for
this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in
Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution
and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard
assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong)
convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical
optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of
Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in
several applications.

one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in
terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such
online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web
caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery
also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose
Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to
address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove
that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy
enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can
range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to
corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed online policy.

equivalence between the Aubin property and the strong regularity for nonlinear
second-order cone programming (SOCP) at a locally optimal solution. We achieve
this by introducing a reduction approach to the Aubin property characterized by
the Mordukhovich criterion and a lemma of alternative choices on cones to
replace the S-lemma used in Outrata and Ram\'irez [SIAM J. Optim. 21 (2011)
789-823] and Opazo, Outrata, and Ram\'irez [SIAM J. Optim. 27 (2017)
2141-2151], where the same SOCP was considered under the strict complementarity
condition except for possibly only one block of constraints. As a byproduct, we
also offer a new approach to the well-known result of Dontchev and Rockafellar
[SIAM J. Optim. 6 (1996) 1087-1105] on the equivalence of the two concepts in
conventional nonlinear programming.

                                        <span>  This article provides a characterization of stability for switched nonlinear
systems under average dwell-time constraints, in terms of necessary and
sufficient conditions involving multiple Lyapunov functions. Earlier converse
results focus on switched systems with dwell-time constraints only, and the
resulting inequalities depend on the flow of individual subsystems. With the
help of a counterexample, we show that a lower bound that guarantees stability
for dwell-time switching signals may not necessarily imply stability for
switching signals with same lower bound on the average dwell-time. Based on
these two observations, we provide a converse result for the average dwell-time
constrained systems in terms of inequalities which do not depend on the flow of
individual subsystems and are easier to check. The particular case of linear
switched systems is studied as a corollary to our main result.

                                        <span>  We present a graph-theoretic modeling approach for hierarchical optimization
that leverages the OptiGraph abstraction implemented in the Julia package
Plasmo$.$jl. We show that the abstraction is flexible and can effectively
capture complex hierarchical connectivity that arises from decision-making over
multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g., integration of planning,
scheduling, and operations in manufacturing and infrastructures). We also show
that the graph abstraction facilitates the conceptualization and implementation
of decomposition and approximation schemes. Specifically, we propose a
graph-based Benders decomposition (gBD) framework that enables the exploitation
of hierarchical (nested) structures and that uses graph
aggregation/partitioning procedures to discover such structures. In addition,
we provide a Julia implementation of gBD, which we call PlasmoBenders$.$jl. We
illustrate the capabilities using examples arising in the context of energy and
power systems.

                                        <span>  The long time behavior and detailed convergence analysis of Langevin
equations has received increased attention over the last years. Difficulties
arise from a lack of coercivity, usually termed hypocoercivity, of the
underlying kinetic Fokker-Planck operator which is a consequence of the
partially deterministic nature of a second order stochastic differential
equation. In this manuscript, the effect of controlling the confinement
potential without altering the original invariant measure is investigated. This
leads to an abstract bilinear control system with an unbounded but
infinite-time admissible control operator which, by means of an artificial
diffusion approach, is shown to possess a unique solution. The compactness of
the underlying semigroup is further used to define an infinite-horizon optimal
control problem on an appropriately reduced state space. Under smallness
assumptions on the initial data, feasibility of and existence of a solution to
the optimal control problem are discussed. Numerical results based on a local
approximation based on a shifted Riccati equation illustrate the theoretical
findings.

G(u)$ with $\alpha\in[0,+\infty)$, where $u$ varies in a set $U\neq\emptyset$
(without further structure). We first show that, excluding at most countably
many values of $\alpha$, we have that $\inf_{H_\alpha^\star}G=
\sup_{H_\alpha^\star}G$, where $H_\alpha^\star := \arg \min_U H_\alpha$, which
is assumed to be non-empty. We further prove a stronger result that concerns
the invariance of the limiting value of the functional $G$ along minimizing
sequences for $H_\alpha$. Moreover, we show to what extent these findings
generalize to multi-regularized functionals and -- in the presence of an
underlying differentiable structure -- to critical points. Finally, the main
result implies an unexpected consequence for functionals regularized with
uniformly convex norms: excluding again at most countably many values of
$\alpha$, it turns out that for a minimizing sequence, convergence to a
minimizer in the weak or strong sense is equivalent.

                                        <span>  Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models
that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated
uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic
Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian
corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models
have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and
robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees.
In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against
sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential
selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as
relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized
such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the
data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust
regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak
submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves
approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's
performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian
optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse
corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.

                                        <span>  We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control
in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate
an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to
capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure
diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the
exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of
the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use
the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a,
2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check
a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a
jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect
parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an
application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price
modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and
parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a
detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.

                                        <span>  Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in
modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in
high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore
limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization
of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization
problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is
proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory
holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and
reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely
characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in
the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically
intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent
inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad
class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution
can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization
error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates
for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical
models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out
to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference
methods.

                                        <span>  Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a
solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while
minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in
various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing.
Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix
factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem
size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention
for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems
such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this
work, we investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP
tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for
general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We
demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key
properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal
solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs
and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently
solve QCQPs.

practical problems such as scheduling and planning. Recently, machine learning
techniques have been utilized to solve ILPs. A straightforward idea is to train
a model via supervised learning, with an ILP as the input and an optimal
solution as the label. An ILP is symmetric if its variables can be permuted
without changing the problem structure, resulting in numerous equivalent and
optimal solutions. Randomly selecting an optimal solution as the label can
introduce variability in the training data, which may hinder the model from
learning stable patterns. In this work, we incorporate the intrinsic symmetry
of ILPs and propose a novel training framework called SymILO. Specifically, we
modify the learning task by introducing solution permutation along with neural
network weights as learnable parameters and then design an alternating
algorithm to jointly optimize the loss function. We conduct extensive
experiments on ILPs involving different symmetries and the computational
results demonstrate that our symmetry-aware approach significantly outperforms
three existing methods -- achieving $50.3\%$, $66.5\%$, and $45.4\%$ average
improvements, respectively.

(VP) algorithm, a powerful tool for solving separable nonlinear optimization
problems across multiple domains, including system identification, image
processing, and machine learning. We first establish a theoretical framework to
examine the effect of the approximate treatment of the coupling relationship
among parameters on the local convergence of the VP algorithm and theoretically
prove that the Kaufman's VP algorithm can achieve a similar convergence rate as
the Golub \& Pereyra's form. These studies fill the gap in the existing
convergence theory analysis, and provide a solid foundation for understanding
the mechanism of VP algorithm and broadening its application horizons.
Furthermore, drawing inspiration from these theoretical revelations, we design
a refined VP algorithm for handling separable nonlinear optimization problems
characterized by large residual, called VPLR, which boosts the convergence
performance by addressing the interdependence of parameters within the
separable model and by continually correcting the approximated Hessian matrix
to counteract the influence of large residual during the iterative process. The
effectiveness of this refined algorithm is corroborated through numerical
experimentation.

                                        <span>  Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management
and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing
efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success
of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\log
T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming (LP)-based
online algorithms. This paper establishes several important facts about online
linear programming, which unveils the challenge for first-order-method-based
online algorithms to achieve beyond $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. To address
the challenge, we introduce a new algorithmic framework that decouples learning
from decision-making. For the first time, we show that first-order methods can
attain regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ with this new framework.

                                        <span>  We study the policy iteration algorithm (PIA) for entropy-regularized
stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon with a large discount
rate, focusing on two main scenarios. First, we analyze PIA with bounded
coefficients where the controls applied to the diffusion term satisfy a
smallness condition. We demonstrate the convergence of PIA based on a uniform
$\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ estimate for the value sequence generated by PIA, and
provide a quantitative convergence analysis for this scenario. Second, we
investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion
term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and
polynomial growth reward function. By such a well-posedess result we achieve
PIA's convergence by establishing a quantitative locally uniform
$\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for the generated value sequence.

                                        <span>  People feel attached to places that are meaningful to them, which
psychological research calls "place attachment." Place attachment is associated
with self-identity, self-continuity, and psychological well-being. Even small
cues, including videos, images, sounds, and scents, can facilitate feelings of
connection and belonging to a place. Telepresence robots that allow people to
see, hear, and interact with a remote place have the potential to establish and
maintain a connection with places and support place attachment. In this paper,
we explore the design space of robotic telepresence to promote place
attachment, including how users might be guided in a remote place and whether
they experience the environment individually or with others. We prototyped a
telepresence robot that allows one or more remote users to visit a place and be
guided by a local human guide or a conversational agent. Participants were 38
university alumni who visited their alma mater via the telepresence robot. Our
findings uncovered four distinct user personas in the remote experience and
highlighted the need for social participation to enhance place attachment. We
generated design implications for future telepresence robot design to support
people's connections with places of personal significance.

in achieving autonomous control for flying insect robots (FIRs) weighing less
than a gram. FIRs, owing to their minuscule weight and size, offer unparalleled
advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size
introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics,
restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been notable
advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from
biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained
hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion
capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hover -- the first
level of "sensor autonomy" -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work
reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21
mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and
15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient
pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter
imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the
state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational
velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of
the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of
1.573 degrees, 0.186 m/s, and 0.139 m, respectively, relative to motion
capture.

various fields such as manufacturing, emergency response and healthcare.
However, a significant challenge that prevents robots from operating in
real-world environments effectively is out-of-distribution (OOD) situations,
wherein robots encounter unforseen situations. One major OOD situations is when
robots encounter faults, making fault adaptation essential for real-world
operation for robots. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms show promising results but suffer from sample inefficiency, leading
to low adaptation speed due to their limited ability to generalize to OOD
situations. Our research is a step towards adding hardware fault tolerance and
fast fault adaptability to machines. In this research, our primary focus is to
investigate the efficacy of generative flow networks in robotic environments,
particularly in the domain of machine fault adaptation. We simulated a robotic
environment called Reacher in our experiments. We modify this environment to
introduce four distinct fault environments that replicate real-world
machines/robot malfunctions. The empirical evaluation of this research
indicates that continuous generative flow networks (CFlowNets) indeed have the
capability to add adaptive behaviors in machines under adversarial conditions.
Furthermore, the comparative analysis of CFlowNets with reinforcement learning
algorithms also provides some key insights into the performance in terms of
adaptation speed and sample efficiency. Additionally, a separate study
investigates the implications of transferring knowledge from pre-fault task to
post-fault environments. Our experiments confirm that CFlowNets has the
potential to be deployed in a real-world machine and it can demonstrate
adaptability in case of malfunctions to maintain functionality.

                                        <span>  Importance sampling is a rare event simulation technique used in Monte Carlo
simulations to bias the sampling distribution towards the rare event of
interest. By assigning appropriate weights to sampled points, importance
sampling allows for more efficient estimation of rare events or tails of
distributions. However, importance sampling can fail when the proposal
distribution does not effectively cover the target distribution. In this work,
we propose a method for more efficient sampling by updating the proposal
distribution in the latent space of a normalizing flow. Normalizing flows learn
an invertible mapping from a target distribution to a simpler latent
distribution. The latent space can be more easily explored during the search
for a proposal distribution, and samples from the proposal distribution are
recovered in the space of the target distribution via the invertible mapping.
We empirically validate our methodology on simulated robotics applications such
as autonomous racing and aircraft ground collision avoidance.

for understanding how they're perceived by people. This study aims to
investigate how the user perception of robots is influenced by displays of
personality. Using LLMs and speech to text technology, we designed a
within-subject study to compare two conditions: a personality-driven robot and
a purely task-oriented, personality-neutral robot. Twelve participants,
recruited from Socially Intelligent Robotics course at Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam, interacted with a robot Nao tasked with asking them a set of medical
questions under both conditions. After completing both interactions, the
participants completed a user experience questionnaire measuring their
emotional states and robot perception using standardized questionnaires from
the SRI and Psychology literature.

                                        <span>  Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aircraft with wide
real-world applications. Energy efficiency is a critical aspect of its
performance, determining the range and duration of the missions that can be
performed. In this study, we show both analytically and numerically that the
optimum of a key energy efficiency index in forward flight, namely energy per
meter traveled per unit mass, is a constant under different vehicle mass
(including payload). Note that this relationship is only true under the optimal
forward velocity that minimizes the energy consumption (under different mass),
but not under arbitrary velocity. The study is based on a previously developed
model capturing the first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor, and a
key step is to prove that the pitch angle under optimal velocity is a constant.
By employing both analytical derivation and validation studies, the research
provides critical insights into the optimization of multirotor energy
efficiency, and facilitate the development of flight control strategies to
extend mission duration and range.

                                        <span>  Numerous problems in physical sciences can be expressed as
parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated family of equilibria
may or may not exist realistically and can be determined after examining its
stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track its
transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change
near the folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability change can be
encoded through a particular projection of the solutions. In this article, we
identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free
ends, a class of problems frequently found in mechanics. Using the developed
theory, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid
lever arm. The examples revealed several instances of snap-back instability in
these systems. These findings may aid in enhancing the design of soft robot
arms and other innovative switching mechanisms.

                                        <span>  A long-term accurate and robust localization system is essential for mobile
robots to operate efficiently outdoors. Recent studies have shown the
significant advantages of the wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit
(Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended
periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the
goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated
navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position
measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the
long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS
signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU
integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the
Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and
mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that
Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation
system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively
estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently,
improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system. The source
code of our implementation is publicly available
(https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-GINS).

function after a stroke. However, for many devices, high costs and lengthy
setup times limit clinical adoption. Thus, we designed, built, and evaluated
the Passive Mechanical Add-on for Treadmill Exercise (P-MATE), a low-cost
passive end-effector add-on for treadmills that couples the movement of the
paretic and non-paretic legs via a reciprocating system of elastic cables and
pulleys. Two human-device mechanical interfaces were designed to attach the
elastic cables to the user. The P-MATE and two interface prototypes were tested
with a physical therapist and eight unimpaired participants. Biomechanical
data, including kinematics and interaction forces, were collected alongside
standardized questionnaires to assess usability and user experience. Both
interfaces were quick and easy to attach, though user experience differed,
highlighting the need for personalization. We also identified areas for future
improvement, including pretension adjustments, tendon derailing prevention, and
understanding long-term impacts on user gait. Our preliminary findings
underline the potential of the P-MATE to provide effective, accessible, and
sustainable stroke gait rehabilitation.

robotic surgery, enabling applications such as autonomous surgical task
execution. Vision-based methods for surgical instrument pose estimation provide
a practical approach to tool tracking, but they often require markers to be
attached to the instruments. Recently, more research has focused on the
development of marker-less methods based on deep learning. However, acquiring
realistic surgical data, with ground truth instrument poses, required for deep
learning training, is challenging. To address the issues in surgical instrument
pose estimation, we introduce the Surgical Robot Instrument Pose Estimation
(SurgRIPE) challenge, hosted at the 26th International Conference on Medical
Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023. The
objectives of this challenge are: (1) to provide the surgical vision community
with realistic surgical video data paired with ground truth instrument poses,
and (2) to establish a benchmark for evaluating markerless pose estimation
methods. The challenge led to the development of several novel algorithms that
showcased improved accuracy and robustness over existing methods. The
performance evaluation study on the SurgRIPE dataset highlights the potential
of these advanced algorithms to be integrated into robotic surgery systems,
paving the way for more precise and autonomous surgical procedures. The
SurgRIPE challenge has successfully established a new benchmark for the field,
encouraging further research and development in surgical robot instrument pose
estimation.

                                        <span>  Unprecedented agility and dexterous manipulation have been demonstrated with
controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), with a significant
impact on legged and humanoid robots. Modern tooling and simulation platforms,
such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances. This article
focuses on demonstrating the applications of Isaac in local planning and
obstacle avoidance as one of the most fundamental ways in which a mobile robot
interacts with its environments. Although there is extensive research on
proprioception-based RL policies, the article highlights less standardized and
reproducible approaches to exteroception. At the same time, the article aims to
provide a base framework for end-to-end local navigation policies and how a
custom robot can be trained in such simulation environment. We benchmark
end-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot
Operating System (ROS). We also cover the sim-to-real transfer process by
demonstrating zero-shot transferability of policies trained in the Isaac
simulator to real-world robots. This is further evidenced by the tests with
different simulated robots, which show the generalization of the learned
policy. Finally, the benchmarks demonstrate comparable performance to Nav2,
opening the door to quick deployment of state-of-the-art end-to-end local
planners for custom robot platforms, but importantly furthering the
possibilities by expanding the state and action spaces or task definitions for
more complex missions. Overall, with this article we introduce the most
important steps, and aspects to consider, in deploying RL policies for local
path planning and obstacle avoidance with Isaac Sim training, Gazebo testing,
and ROS 2 for real-time inference in real robots. The code is available at

items by robot hands forms a special challenge in robot grasp mechanics. This
paper considers the steering of flexible linear objects in planar environments
by two robot hands. The flexible linear object, modeled as an elastic
non-stretchable rod, is manipulated by varying the gripping endpoint positions
while keeping equal endpoint tangents. The flexible linear object shape has a
closed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents,
called Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the
optimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain
closed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle
avoidance of the flexible linear object. The new tools are incorporated into a
planning scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments
populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The scheme is fully implemented and
demonstrated with detailed examples.

                                        <span>  Road damage detection and assessment are crucial components of infrastructure
maintenance. However, current methods often struggle with detecting multiple
types of road damage in a single image, particularly at varying scales. This is
due to the lack of road datasets with various damage types having varying
scales. To overcome this deficiency, first, we present a novel dataset called
Diverse Road Damage Dataset (DRDD) for road damage detection that captures the
diverse road damage types in individual images, addressing a crucial gap in
existing datasets. Then, we provide our model, RDD4D, that exploits Attention4D
blocks, enabling better feature refinement across multiple scales. The
Attention4D module processes feature maps through an attention mechanism
combining positional encoding and "Talking Head" components to capture local
and global contextual information. In our comprehensive experimental analysis
comparing various state-of-the-art models on our proposed, our enhanced model
demonstrated superior performance in detecting large-sized road cracks with an
Average Precision (AP) of 0.458 and maintained competitive performance with an
overall AP of 0.445. Moreover, we also provide results on the CrackTinyNet
dataset; our model achieved around a 0.21 increase in performance. The code,
model weights, dataset, and our results are available on

                                        <span>  Accurate spatiotemporal calibration is a prerequisite for multisensor fusion.
However, sensors are typically asynchronous, and there is no overlap between
the fields of view of cameras and LiDARs, posing challenges for intrinsic and
extrinsic parameter calibration. To address this, we propose a calibration
pipeline based on continuous-time and bundle adjustment (BA) capable of
simultaneous intrinsic and extrinsic calibration (6 DOF transformation and time
offset). We do not require overlapping fields of view or any calibration board.
Firstly, we establish data associations between cameras using Structure from
Motion (SFM) and perform self-calibration of camera intrinsics. Then, we
establish data associations between LiDARs through adaptive voxel map
construction, optimizing for extrinsic calibration within the map. Finally, by
matching features between the intensity projection of LiDAR maps and camera
images, we conduct joint optimization for intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
This pipeline functions in texture-rich structured environments, allowing
simultaneous calibration of any number of cameras and LiDARs without the need
for intricate sensor synchronization triggers. Experimental results demonstrate
our method's ability to fulfill co-visibility and motion constraints between
sensors without accumulating errors.

                                        <span>  Mobile manipulators typically encounter significant challenges in navigating
narrow, cluttered environments due to their high-dimensional state spaces and
complex kinematics. While reactive methods excel in dynamic settings, they
struggle to efficiently incorporate complex, coupled constraints across the
entire state space. In this work, we present a novel local reactive controller
that reformulates the time-domain single-step problem into a multi-step
optimization problem in the spatial domain, leveraging the propagation of a
serial kinematic chain. This transformation facilitates the formulation of
customized, decoupled link-specific constraints, which is further solved
efficiently with augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming
(AL-DDP). Our approach naturally absorbs spatial kinematic propagation in the
forward pass and processes all link-specific constraints simultaneously during
the backward pass, enhancing both constraint management and computational
efficiency. Notably, in this framework, we formulate collision avoidance
constraints for each link using accurate geometric models with extracted free
regions, and this improves the maneuverability of the mobile manipulator in
narrow, cluttered spaces. Experimental results showcase significant
improvements in safety, efficiency, and task completion rates. These findings
underscore the robustness of the proposed method, particularly in narrow,
cluttered environments where conventional approaches could falter. The

accurate localization of wireless capsule endoscope robots. Traditional
tracking algorithms, based on the magnetic dipole model and Levenberg-Marquardt
(LM) algorithm, face challenges related to computational delays and the need
for initial position estimation. More recently proposed neural network-based
approaches often require extensive hardware calibration and real-world data
collection, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these
challenges, we propose MobilePosenet, a lightweight neural network architecture
that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to minimize computational cost
and a channel attention mechanism to enhance localization accuracy. Besides,
the inputs to the network integrate the sensors' coordinate information and
random noise, compensating for the discrepancies between the theoretical model
and the actual magnetic fields and thus allowing MobilePosenet to be trained
entirely on theoretical data. Experimental evaluations conducted in a \(90
\times 90 \times 80\) mm workspace demonstrate that MobilePosenet exhibits
excellent 5-DOF localization accuracy ($1.54 \pm 1.03$ mm and $2.24 \pm
1.84^{\circ}$) and inference speed (0.9 ms) against state-of-the-art methods
trained on real-world data. Since network training relies solely on theoretical
data, MobilePosenet can eliminate the hardware calibration and real-world data
collection process, improving the generalizability of this permanent magnet
localization method and the potential for rapid adoption in different clinical
settings.

Lifelong MAPF (L-MAPF), where agents are continuously reassigned new targets
upon completing their current tasks, offers a more realistic approximation of
real-world warehouse scenarios. While cache storage systems can enhance
efficiency and reduce operational costs, existing approaches primarily rely on
expectations and mathematical models, often without adequately addressing the
challenges of multi-robot planning and execution. In this paper, we introduce a
novel mechanism called Lifelong MAPF with Cache Mechanism (L-MAPF-CM), which
integrates high-level cache storage with low-level path planning. We have
involved a new type of map grid called cache for temporary item storage.
Additionally, we involved a task assigner (TA) with a locking mechanism to
bridge the gap between the new cache grid and L-MAPF algorithm. The TA
dynamically allocates target locations to agents based on their status in
various scenarios. We evaluated L-MAPF-CM using different cache replacement
policies and task distributions. L-MAPF-CM has demonstrated performance
improvements particularly with high cache hit rates and smooth traffic
conditions.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel framework to handle a multi-agent path finding
problem under a limited communication range constraint, where all agents must
have a connected communication channel to the rest of the team. Many existing
approaches to multi-agent path finding (e.g., leader-follower platooning)
overcome computational challenges of planning in this domain by planning one
agent at a time in a fixed order. However, fixed leader-follower approaches can
become stuck during planning, limiting their practical utility in dense-clutter
environments. To overcome this limitation, we develop dynamic leading
multi-agent path finding, which allows for dynamic reselection of the leading
agent during path planning whenever progress cannot be made. The experiments
show the efficiency of our framework, which can handle up to 25 agents with
more than 90% success-rate across five environment types where baselines
routinely fail.

                                        <span>  The Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system has become a standard feature in recent
car models. While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the
system's operational characteristics and safety performance remain
underexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive
data. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from
leading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we
collected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network
(CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral
trajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced
vision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse,
challenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather,
degraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM)
further annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic
features. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's
operational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is
vulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in
lane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended
departures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to
frequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems
consistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight
curves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how
this dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving
technology. In view of LKA's limitations, we recommend improvements in road
geometry and pavement maintenance. Additionally, we illustrate how the dataset
supports the development of human-like LKA systems via VLM fine-tuning and
Chain of Thought reasoning.

multi-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance and
expand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces \textbf{3D-ViTac}, a
multi-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanual
manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensing
units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost and
flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts,
effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual
data, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their
3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can
then be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Through
concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots can
perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-only
policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing
long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation. Our project page is

                                        <span>  Space poses significant challenges for humans, leading to physiological
adaptations in response to an environment vastly different from Earth. A
comprehensive understanding of these physiological adaptations is needed to
devise effective countermeasures to support human life in space. This narrative
review first focuses on the impact of the environment in space on the
musculoskeletal system. It highlights the complex interplay between bone and
muscle adaptations and their implications on astronaut health.
  Despite advances in current countermeasures, such as resistive exercise and
pharmacological interventions, they remain partially effective, bulky, and
resource-intensive, posing challenges for future missions aboard compact
spacecraft. This review proposes wearable sensing and robotic technology as a
promising alternative to overcome these limitations. Wearable systems, such as
sensor-integrated suits and (soft) exoskeletons, can provide real-time
monitoring, dynamic loading, and exercise protocols tailored to individual
needs. These systems are lightweight, modular, and capable of operating in
confined environments, making them ideal for long-duration missions.
  In addition to space applications, wearable technologies hold significant
promise for terrestrial uses, supporting rehabilitation and assistance for the
ageing population, individuals with musculoskeletal disorders, and enhance
physical performance in healthy users. By integrating advanced materials,
sensors and actuators, and intelligent and energy-efficient control, these
technologies can bridge gaps in current countermeasures while offering broader
applications on Earth.

                                        <span>  Adaptive control is often used for friction compensation in trajectory
tracking tasks because it does not require torque sensors. However, it has some
drawbacks: first, the most common certainty-equivalence adaptive control design
is based on linearized parameterization of the friction model, therefore
nonlinear effects, including the stiction and Stribeck effect, are usually
omitted. Second, the adaptive control-based estimation can be biased due to
non-zero steady-state error. Third, neglecting unknown model mismatch could
result in non-robust estimation. This paper proposes a novel linear
parameterized friction model capturing the nonlinear static friction
phenomenon. Subsequently, an adaptive control-based friction estimator is
proposed to reduce the bias during estimation based on backstepping. Finally,
we propose an algorithm to generate excitation for robust estimation. Using a
KUKA iiwa 14, we conducted trajectory tracking experiments to evaluate the
estimated friction model, including random Fourier and drawing trajectories,
showing the effectiveness of our methodology in different control schemes.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a Sim2Real (Simulation to Reality) approach to bridge the
gap between a trained agent in a simulated environment and its real-world
implementation in navigating a robot in a similar setting. Specifically, we
focus on navigating a quadruped robot in a real-world grid-like environment
inspired by the Gymnasium Frozen Lake -- a highly user-friendly and free
Application Programming Interface (API) to develop and test Reinforcement
Learning (RL) algorithms. We detail the development of a pipeline to transfer
motion policies learned in the Frozen Lake simulation to a physical quadruped
robot, thus enabling autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in a grid
without relying on expensive localization and mapping sensors. The work
involves training an RL agent in the Frozen Lake environment and utilizing the
resulting Q-table to control a 12 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) quadruped robot. In
addition to detailing the RL implementation, inverse kinematics-based quadruped
gaits, and the transfer policy pipeline, we open-source the project on GitHub
and include a demonstration video of our Sim2Real transfer approach. This work
provides an accessible, straightforward, and low-cost framework for
researchers, students, and hobbyists to explore and implement RL-based robot
navigation in real-world grid environments.

object-in-hand pose estimation, which is crucial for robotic in-hand
manipulation within the ``Perception-Planning-Control" paradigm. Specifically,
we introduce VinT-6D, the first extensive multi-modal dataset integrating
vision, touch, and proprioception, to enhance robotic manipulation. VinT-6D
comprises 2 million VinT-Sim and 0.1 million VinT-Real splits, collected via
simulations in MuJoCo and Blender and a custom-designed real-world platform.
This dataset is tailored for robotic hands, offering models with whole-hand
tactile perception and high-quality, well-aligned data. To the best of our
knowledge, the VinT-Real is the largest considering the collection difficulties
in the real-world environment so that it can bridge the gap of simulation to
real compared to the previous works. Built upon VinT-6D, we present a benchmark
method that shows significant improvements in performance by fusing multi-modal

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have been fueled by
large-scale data and deep neural networks, particularly for high-dimensional
and complex tasks. Online RL methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
are effective in dynamic scenarios but require substantial real-time data,
posing challenges in resource-constrained or slow simulation environments.
Offline RL addresses this by pre-learning policies from large datasets, though
its success depends on the quality and diversity of the data. This work
proposes a framework that enhances PPO algorithms by incorporating a diffusion
model to generate high-quality virtual trajectories for offline datasets. This
approach improves exploration and sample efficiency, leading to significant
gains in cumulative rewards, convergence speed, and strategy stability in
complex tasks. Our contributions are threefold: we explore the potential of
diffusion models in RL, particularly for offline datasets, extend the
application of online RL to offline environments, and experimentally validate
the performance improvements of PPO with diffusion models. These findings
provide new insights and methods for applying RL to high-dimensional, complex
tasks. Finally, we open-source our code at https://github.com/TianciGao/DiffPPO

                                        <span>  Obtaining dynamic models of continuum soft robots is central to the analysis
and control of soft robots, and researchers have devoted much attention to the
challenge of proposing both data-driven and first-principle solutions. Both
avenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and
performs poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant
simplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This
paper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional,
physics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start
with an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine
the minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement.
Following this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification
algorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We
validate our approach through simulations with various planar soft
manipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies,
showing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more
accurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that
thanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible
models, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based
control policies.

                                        <span>  Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel brightness changes.The high-temporal resolution and asynchronicity of
event cameras offer great potential for estimating robot motion states. Recent
works have adopted the continuous-time estimation methods to exploit the
inherent nature of event cameras. However, existing methods either have poor
runtime performance or neglect the high-temporal resolution of event cameras.
To alleviate it, an Asynchronous Event-driven Visual Odometry (AsynEVO) based
on sparse Gaussian Process (GP) regression is proposed to efficiently infer the
motion trajectory from pure event streams. Concretely, an asynchronous frontend
pipeline is designed to adapt event-driven feature tracking and manage feature
trajectories; a parallel dynamic sliding-window backend is presented within the
framework of sparse GP regression on $SE(3)$. Notably, a dynamic
marginalization strategy is employed to ensure the consistency and sparsity of
this GP regression. Experiments conducted on public datasets and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that AsynEVO achieves competitive precision and superior
robustness compared to the state-of-the-art.The experiment in the
repeated-texture scenario indicates that the high-temporal resolution of
AsynEVO plays a vital role in the estimation of high-speed movement.
Furthermore, we show that the computational efficiency of AsynEVO significantly
outperforms the incremental method.

supposed to re-configure the objects into a desired goal configuration
specified by an RGB-D image. Recent works explore unknown object rearrangement
systems by incorporating learning-based perception modules. However, they are
sensitive to perception error, and pay less attention to task-level
performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective system for unknown
object rearrangement amidst perception noise. We theoretically reveal that the
noisy perception impacts grasp and place in a decoupled way, and show such a
decoupled structure is valuable to improve task optimality. We propose GSP, a
dual-loop system with the decoupled structure as prior. For the inner loop, we
learn a see policy for self-confident in-hand object matching. For the outer
loop, we learn a grasp policy aware of object matching and grasp capability
guided by task-level rewards. We leverage the foundation model CLIP for object
matching, policy learning and self-termination. A series of experiments
indicate that GSP can conduct unknown object rearrangement with higher
completion rates and fewer steps.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we investigate the prospects and challenges of sensor suites
in achieving autonomous control for flying insect robots (FIRs) weighing less
than a gram. FIRs, owing to their minuscule weight and size, offer unparalleled
advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size
introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics,
restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been notable
advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from
biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained
hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion
capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hover -- the first
level of "sensor autonomy" -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work
reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21
mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and
15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient
pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter
imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the
state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational
velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of
the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of
1.573 degrees, 0.186 m/s, and 0.139 m, respectively, relative to motion
capture.

                                        <span>  In power system steady-state estimation (PSSE), one needs to consider (1) the
need for robust statistics, (2) the nonconvex transmission constraints, (3) the
fast-varying nature of the inputs, and the corresponding need to track optimal
trajectories as closely as possible. In combination, these challenges have not
been considered, yet. In this paper, we address all three challenges. The need
for robustness (1) is addressed by using an approach based on the so-called
Huber model. The non-convexity (2) of the problem, which results in first order
methods failing to find global minima, is dealt with by applying global
methods. One of these methods is based on a mixed integer quadratic
formulation, which provides results of several orders of magnitude better than
conventional gradient descent. Lastly, the trajectory tracking (3) is discussed
by showing under which conditions the trajectory tracking of the SDP
relaxations has meaning.

are determined as a function of the states of all nodes in the network.
Motivated by applications where the global state cannot be reconstructed in
real time due to limitations in the collection, communication, and processing
of data, here we introduce a control approach in which the control actions can
be computed as a function of the states of the nodes within a limited state
information neighborhood. The trade-off between the control performance and the
size of this neighborhood is primarily determined by the condition number of
the controllability Gramian. Our theoretical results are supported by
simulations on regular and random networks and are further illustrated by an
application to the control of power-grid synchronization. We demonstrate that
for well-conditioned Gramians, there is no significant loss of control
performance as the size of the state information neighborhood is reduced,
allowing efficient control of large networks using only local information.

policies for stochastic systems under safety and reach-avoid specifications.
Using a game-theoretical framework, we consider the setting where the
probability distribution of the disturbance at each time step is selected from
an ambiguity set defined by the Wasserstein distance. The goal is to synthesize
a distributionally robust control policy that ensures the satisfaction
probability exceeds a specified threshold under any distribution within the
ambiguity set. First, for both safety and reach-avoid specifications, we
establish the existence of optimal policies by leveraging the dynamic
programming principles. Then we demonstrate how the associated optimization
problem can be efficiently solved using the dual representation of Wasserstein
distributionally robust optimization. Furthermore, for safety specifications in
particular, we introduce a novel concept of distributionally robust control
barrier certificates and show how these enable the efficient synthesis of
controllers through sum-of-squares programming techniques. Finally, our
experimental results reveal that incorporating distributional robustness during
the synthesis phase significantly improves the satisfaction probability during
online execution, even with limited statistical knowledge of the disturbance
distribution.

real-world applications. Energy efficiency is a critical aspect of its
performance, determining the range and duration of the missions that can be
performed. In this study, we show both analytically and numerically that the
optimum of a key energy efficiency index in forward flight, namely energy per
meter traveled per unit mass, is a constant under different vehicle mass
(including payload). Note that this relationship is only true under the optimal
forward velocity that minimizes the energy consumption (under different mass),
but not under arbitrary velocity. The study is based on a previously developed
model capturing the first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor, and a
key step is to prove that the pitch angle under optimal velocity is a constant.
By employing both analytical derivation and validation studies, the research
provides critical insights into the optimization of multirotor energy
efficiency, and facilitate the development of flight control strategies to
extend mission duration and range.

                                        <span>  Secure communication is crucial in many emerging systems enabled by unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks. To protect legitimate
communication in a chaotic UAV environment, where both eavesdropping and
jamming become straightforward from multiple adversaries with line-of-sight
signal propagation, a new reliable and integrated physical layer security
mechanism is proposed in this paper for a massive
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) UAV system. Particularly, a physical
layer fingerprint, also called a tag, is first embedded into each message for
authentication purpose. We then propose to reuse the tag additionally as a
reference to encode each message to ensure secrecy for confidentiality
enhancement at a low cost. Specifically, we create a new dual-reference
symmetric tag generation mechanism by inputting an encoding-insensitive feature
of plaintext along with the key into a hash function. At a legitimate receiver,
an expected tag, reliable for decoding, can be symmetrically regenerated based
on the received ciphertext, and authentication can be performed by comparing
the regenerated reference tag to the received tag. However, an illegitimate
receiver can only receive the fuzzy tag which can not be used to decode the
received message. Additionally, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to degrade
eavesdropping to further decrease message leakage. To verify the efficiency of
our proposed tag-based encoding (TBE) scheme, we formulate two optimization
problems including ergodic sum secrecy rate maximization and authentication
fail probability minimization. The power allocation solutions are derived by
difference-of-convex (DC) programming and the Lagrange method, respectively.
The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TBE
approach compared to the prior AN-aided tag embedding scheme.

                                        <span>  If a crash between two vehicles is imminent, an Automatic Emergency Brake
(AEB) is activated to avoid or mitigate the accident. However, the trigger
mechanism of the AEB relies on the vehicle's onboard sensors, such as radar and
cameras, that require a line of sight to detect the crash opponent. If the line
of sight is impaired, for example by bad weather or an obstruction, the AEB
cannot be activated in time to avoid the crash. To deal with these cases, a
2-stage braking system is proposed, where the first stage consists of a partial
brake that is triggered by Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The
second stage is composed of the standard AEB that is triggered exclusively by
an onboard sensor detection. The performance of this V2X-enhanced 2-stage
braking system is analysed in obstructed crossing use cases and the results are
compared against the use of an AEB-only system. The benefit is quantitatively
assessed by determination of the crash avoidance rate and, if the crash cannot
be avoided, by estimation of the crash severity mitigation.

                                        <span>  The paper derives new conditions for global convergence of the adaptive
moment generation algorithm when applied for on-line, or equivalently,
recursive supervised learning of static and dynamic nonlinear systems. The
paper also proposes a difference equation based nonlinear dynamic model, that
enforces {\em structure} and results in a new type of recurrent neural network.
The convergence analysis applies averaging using Ljung's associated
differential equation method. It is first proved that the asymptotic update
behaviour of the adaptive moment generation algorithm is equivalent to a scaled
stochastic gradient update for the standard hyper-parameter setting, or
equivalent to a sign-sign update strategy in case the internal filtering of the
algorithm is turned off. The analysis is concluded by proving global
convergence to the set of parameters that gives a correct input-output
description of the true system. The two hyper-parameter settings are evaluated
with a Monte-Carlo analysis when the adaptive moment generation algorithm is
applied for learning of nonlinear automotive cruise control dynamics. This
validates the correct operation of the structured recurrent neural network and
confirms the expected reduced convergence speed for the sign-sign update case.

                                        <span>  Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) are emerging as a promising solution to
improving fault tolerance, charge and thermal balance, energy delivery, etc. To
optimize these performance metrics, high-dimensional nonlinear integer
programming problems need to be formulated and solved. During this process, it
is necessary to address multiple challenges stemming from nonlinear battery
characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well
as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale systems. Thus, we
propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various potential
configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs, significantly
facilitating the topology design and optimization problem formulation for RBSs.
Moreover, to solve the formulated RBS problems, the search space is tailored to
encompass only feasible SSVs, thereby ensuring safe system operation while
substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed methods, focusing on
unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid
foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal
control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are
demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests.

                                        <span>  Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) prevents system collapse during large
disturbances. Increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and
reduced system inertia makes it challenging to design a static UFLS scheme,
which relies on preset frequency thresholds and load shed fractions to meet
design criteria across all possible operating conditions. Due to non-linearity
and traceability issues, previous adaptive UFLS schemes use simplified
tractable frequency models that overlook AC network effects such as
voltage-dependent load/generation. This paper leverages model order reduction
techniques to obtain a higher fidelity low-order model of system frequency
dynamics that captures AC network effects while incorporating turbine governor
action and their associated limits. The model is then used in a new AC-aware
predictive optimization framework to adapt UFLS setpoints periodically based on
current operating conditions while minimizing load shed. Validated on a
1,648-bus system with PSS/E simulations, the proposed method meets design
criteria under various operating conditions and disturbance scenarios.
Furthermore, the framework outperforms conventional static UFLS schemes and
adaptive UFLS schemes based on simplified dynamic models.

                                        <span>  Fast and robust dynamic state estimation (DSE) is essential for accurately
capturing the internal dynamic processes of power systems, and it serves as the
foundation for reliably implementing real-time dynamic modeling, monitoring,
and control applications. Nonetheless, on one hand, traditional DSE methods
based on Kalman filtering or particle filtering have high accuracy requirements
for system parameters, control inputs, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and
centralized DSE communication. Consequently, these methods often face accuracy
bottlenecks when dealing with structural or system process errors, unknown
control vectors, PMU anomalies, and communication contingencies. On the other
hand, deep learning-aided DSE, while parameter-free, often suffers from
generalization issues under unforeseen operating conditions. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes an effective approach that leverages deep
generative models from AI-generated content (AIGC) to assist DSE. The proposed
approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture to estimate unknown control
input variables, a robust encoder to mitigate the impact of bad PMU data, and
latent diffusion model to address communication issues in centralized DSE.
Additionally, a lightweight adaptor is designed to quickly adjust the latent
vector distribution. Extensive experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system
and the NPCC 140-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method in addressing DSE modeling imperfection, measurement
uncertainties, communication contingencies, and unknown distribution
challenges, while also proving its ability to reduce data storage and
communication resource requirements.

unknown Bernoulli packet drop channel. The unknown packet drop probability is
estimated using finite samples, then the estimated probability is used to
design a formally equivalent optimal controller. If the estimation error is too
large, the estimated controller cannot mean-square stabilize the system. For
n-dimensional systems, the upper bound on the estimation error is provided to
guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. And we present an analytical
expression for the gap between the performance of the estimated controller and
the optimal performance. Next, we derive the upper bound on sample complexity
for the stabilizability of the estimated controller. The tailored results with
less conservatism are delivered for scalar systems and n-dimensional systems
with invertible input matrix. Furthermore, a sufficient condition that does not
depend on unknown channel information is provided to determine whether the
estimated controller stabilizes the system with a certain probability. Finally,
Numerical examples are used to demonstrate our results.

solution for large scale and wide coverage of future wireless networks. By
integrating both the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and the terrestrial network
(TN), SGIN can provide high speed and omnipresent wireless network access for
the users using the predefined licensed spectrums. Considering the scarcity of
the spectrum resource and the low spectrum efficiency of the SGIN, we enable
the NTN and TN to share the spectrum to improve overall system performance,
i.e., weighted-sum area data rate (WS-ADR). However, mutual interference
between NTN and TN is often inevitable and thus causes SGIN performance
degradation. In this work, we consider a ground protection zone for the TN base
stations, in which the NTN users are only allowed to use the NTN reserved
spectrum to mitigate the NTN and TN mutual interference. We analytically derive
the coverage probability and area data rate (ADR) of the typical users and
study the performance under various protection zone sizes and spectrum
allocation parameter settings. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate
that the WS-ADR could be maximized by selecting the appropriate radius of
protection zone and bandwidth allocation factor in the SGIN.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we investigate finite-horizon optimal density steering
problems for discrete-time stochastic linear dynamical systems whose state
probability densities can be represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our
goal is to compute optimal controllers that can ensure that the terminal state
distribution will match the desired distribution exactly (hard-constrained
version) or closely (soft-constrained version) where in the latter case we
employ a Wasserstein like metric that can measure the distance between
different GMMs. Our approach relies on a class of randomized control policies
which allow us to reformulate the proposed density steering problems as
finite-dimensional optimization problems, and in particular, linear and
bilinear programs. Additionally, we explore more general density steering
problems based on the approximation of general distributions by GMMs and
characterize bounds for the error between the terminal distribution under our
policy and the approximated GMM terminal state distribution. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through non-trivial numerical
experiments.

                                        <span>  Mobile manipulators typically encounter significant challenges in navigating
narrow, cluttered environments due to their high-dimensional state spaces and
complex kinematics. While reactive methods excel in dynamic settings, they
struggle to efficiently incorporate complex, coupled constraints across the
entire state space. In this work, we present a novel local reactive controller
that reformulates the time-domain single-step problem into a multi-step
optimization problem in the spatial domain, leveraging the propagation of a
serial kinematic chain. This transformation facilitates the formulation of
customized, decoupled link-specific constraints, which is further solved
efficiently with augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming
(AL-DDP). Our approach naturally absorbs spatial kinematic propagation in the
forward pass and processes all link-specific constraints simultaneously during
the backward pass, enhancing both constraint management and computational
efficiency. Notably, in this framework, we formulate collision avoidance
constraints for each link using accurate geometric models with extracted free
regions, and this improves the maneuverability of the mobile manipulator in
narrow, cluttered spaces. Experimental results showcase significant
improvements in safety, efficiency, and task completion rates. These findings
underscore the robustness of the proposed method, particularly in narrow,
cluttered environments where conventional approaches could falter. The

location that utilizes current measurements along with the branch-bus matrix,
providing another option besides the traditional voltage-based methods. To
enhance fault location accuracy in the presence of multiple outliers, the
robust YALL1 algorithm is used to resist outlier interference and accurately
recover the sparse vector, thereby pinpointing the fault precisely. The results

                                        <span>  Based on the vision of global coverage for sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communication systems, the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground channel
model for urban scenarios has emerged as highly important for the system
design. In this paper, we propose an LEO satellite-to-ground channel model
through shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) algorithm to analyze the channel
characteristics. The orbit of LEO is modeled by the simplified general
perturbations 4 (SGP4), and an accurate celestial model is applied to calculate
the Doppler shift of multipath in a transmission time window of LEO
satellite-to-ground communications. Channel characteristics of LEO
satellite-to-ground communications such as the root-mean-square (RMS) delay
spread, the Doppler shift, and the received power at different times are
obtained. The simulation results show that the received power is only
significantly noticeable in the transmission time window when the satellite is
close to the receiver. Proposed model validates the effectiveness of
ray-tracing in actual LEO satellite-to-ground communication scenarios and
extends the calculation of the Doppler shift.

                                        <span>  To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks
(NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than
is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks,
are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands
remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs
can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However,
in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive
coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs
make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and
TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing
(SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application
scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches
related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in
STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases
the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future
research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.

wholesale market while maintaining the tractability of associated market
operation tools such as unit commitment (UC), existing DER aggregation (DERA)
studies usually consider that each DERA is presented on a single node of the
transmission network. Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical
distribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission
nodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs
(M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows
is a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to
DERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the
distribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in
industry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC
(CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs,
treated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against
aggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are
modeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging
historical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space.
With this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which
is reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders
decomposition. The proposed method is tested on an IEEE 24-bus system to
illustrate its effectiveness in managing M-DERA integration while ensuring
operational economics and mitigating the overloading of transmission lines.

systems. This paper introduces a generalized reset feedback control structure
that integrates a single reset-state reset controller, a shaping filter for
tuning reset actions, and linear compensators arranged in series and parallel
configurations with the reset controller. This structure offers greater tuning
flexibility to optimize reset control performance. However, frequency-domain
analysis for such systems remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, this
study makes three key contributions: (1) developing Higher-Order Sinusoidal
Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) for open-loop reset control systems; (2)
deriving HOSIDFs for closed-loop reset control systems and establishing a
connection with open-loop analysis; and (3) creating a MATLAB-based App to
implement these methods, providing mechatronics engineers with a practical tool
for reset control system design and analysis. The accuracy of the proposed
methods is validated through simulations and experiments. Finally, the utility
of the proposed methods is demonstrated through case studies that analyze and
compare the performance of three controllers: a PID controller, a reset
controller, and a shaped reset controller on a precision motion stage. Both
analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the shaped reset
controller provides higher tracking precision while reducing actuation forces,
outperforming both the reset and PID controllers. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain methods in analyzing and

                                        <span>  The combined use of data from different sources can be critical in
emergencies, where accurate models are needed to make real-time decisions, but
high-fidelity representations and detailed information are simply unavailable.
This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman
filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in
a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a
complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to
sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction
of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such
observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively
adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by
balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at
each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on
approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available
during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework
sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing
a reliable contaminant concentration map.

smooth control methodology for a distributed space telescope demonstration
mission. The distributed space telescope has a flexible focal length that
corresponds to the relative position in the formation flying concept. The
limited specification of a CubeSat generally restricts the performance of
actuators, most critically the degrees of freedom of controlled motion. This
investigation leads to the development of an adaptive smooth control
methodology via nonsingular fast terminal sliding modes. The adaptive smooth
control algorithm that was developed for a single-input single-output system is
adopted and extended to the relative orbit and attitude control systems of the
distributed space telescope. The software simulation is conducted under a real
mission, which means the real CubeSat structures, hardware specifications, and
operational constraints. The proposed algorithm possesses only seven parameters
that can be easily adjusted considering their physical meanings. Furthermore,
the pre-designated error bounds are analytically derived, which enhances the
applicability of the algorithm to real missions. The simulation compares the
efficiency of the adaptive smooth nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode
controller with the linear quadratic regulator and proportional derivative
algorithms. The results verify that the adaptive smooth nonsingular fast
terminal sliding mode control algorithm shows better control performance in the
perspective of the alignment time and the fuel consumption for the distributed
space telescope demonstration mission.

tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate
the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and
the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the
corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for
the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as
the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable
parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control
strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error
upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio.
Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the
joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system.
By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative
error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's
efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a
multi-agent formation control example.

solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for
better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with
load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer
distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the
incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to
real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized
approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO
formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line
congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed
methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion
behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at
different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc
goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and
optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than
economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in
minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the
line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable
amount.

                                        <span>  In power system steady-state estimation (PSSE), one needs to consider (1) the
need for robust statistics, (2) the nonconvex transmission constraints, (3) the
fast-varying nature of the inputs, and the corresponding need to track optimal
trajectories as closely as possible. In combination, these challenges have not
been considered, yet. In this paper, we address all three challenges. The need
for robustness (1) is addressed by using an approach based on the so-called
Huber model. The non-convexity (2) of the problem, which results in first order
methods failing to find global minima, is dealt with by applying global
methods. One of these methods is based on a mixed integer quadratic
formulation, which provides results of several orders of magnitude better than
conventional gradient descent. Lastly, the trajectory tracking (3) is discussed
by showing under which conditions the trajectory tracking of the SDP
relaxations has meaning.

                                        <span>  We study the basic computational problem of detecting approximate stationary
points for continuous piecewise affine (PA) functions. Our contributions span
multiple aspects, including complexity, regularity, and algorithms.
Specifically, we show that testing first-order approximate stationarity
concepts, as defined by commonly used generalized subdifferentials, is
computationally intractable unless P=NP. To facilitate computability, we
consider a polynomial-time solvable relaxation by abusing the convex
subdifferential sum rule and establish a tight characterization of its
exactness. Furthermore, addressing an open issue motivated by the need to
terminate the subgradient method in finite time, we introduce the first
oracle-polynomial-time algorithm to detect so-called near-approximate
stationary points for PA functions.
  A notable byproduct of our development in regularity is the first necessary
and sufficient condition for the validity of an equality-type (Clarke)
subdifferential sum rule. Our techniques revolve around two new geometric
notions for convex polytopes and may be of independent interest in nonsmooth
analysis. Moreover, some corollaries of our work on complexity and algorithms
for stationarity testing address open questions in the literature. To
demonstrate the versatility of our results, we complement our findings with
applications to a series of structured piecewise smooth functions, including
$\rho$-margin-loss SVM, piecewise affine regression, and nonsmooth neural
networks.

                                        <span>  Numerous problems in physical sciences can be expressed as
parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated family of equilibria
may or may not exist realistically and can be determined after examining its
stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track its
transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change
near the folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability change can be
encoded through a particular projection of the solutions. In this article, we
identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free
ends, a class of problems frequently found in mechanics. Using the developed
theory, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid
lever arm. The examples revealed several instances of snap-back instability in
these systems. These findings may aid in enhancing the design of soft robot
arms and other innovative switching mechanisms.

                                        <span>  Factorizations over cones and their duals play central roles for many areas
of mathematics and computer science. One of the reasons behind this is the
ability to find a representation for various objects using a well-structured
family of cones, where the representation is captured by the factorizations
over these cones. Several major questions about factorizations over cones
remain open even for such well-structured families of cones as non-negative
orthants and positive semidefinite cones. Having said that, we possess a far
better understanding of factorizations over non-negative orthants and positive
semidefinite cones than over other families of cones. One of the key properties
that led to this better understanding is the ability to normalize
factorizations, i.e., to guarantee that the norms of the vectors involved in
the factorizations are bounded in terms of an input and in terms of a constant
dependent on the given cone. Our work aims at understanding which cones
guarantee that factorizations over them can be normalized, and how this effects
extension complexity of polytopes over such cones.

Using a resolvent-like operator, we first establish the finite-approximate
controllability for linear systems. Subsequently, by applying the Schauder
fixed-point theorem (SFPT), we prove the existence of a solution and
demonstrate the finite-approximate controllability of semilinear impulsive
systems in Hilbert spaces. Finally, we extend these results to a broader
application, specifically to the heat equation.

                                        <span>  Inspired by the impact of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on combinatorial
optimization, we construct an analogous relax-then-sample strategy for low-rank
optimization problems. First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic
optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized
rounding scheme, which obtains provably near-optimal solutions, mimicking the
blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. We then extend
our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new
semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than
those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large
semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in
these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence
improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including
matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to
reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically
illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and our sampling
scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion
problems.

optimisation of space-time periodic principal eigenvalues. Namely, considering
a fixed time horizon $T$ and the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, let, for
any $m\in L^\infty((0,T)\times\mathbb{T}^d)$, $\lambda(m)$ be the principal
eigenvalue of the operator $\partial_t-\Delta-m$ endowed with (time-space)
periodic boundary conditions. The main question we set out to answer is the
following: how to choose $m$ so as to minimise $\lambda(m)$? This question
stems from population dynamics. We prove that in several cases it is always
beneficial to rearrange $m$ with respect to time in a symmetric way, which is
the first comparison result for the rearrangement in time of parabolic
equations. Furthermore, we investigate the validity (or lack thereof) of
Talenti inequalities for the rearrangement in time of parabolic equations. The
numerical simulations which illustrate our results were obtained by developing
a framework within which it is possible to optimise criteria with respect to
functions having a prescribed rearrangement (or distribution function).

problems for discrete-time stochastic linear dynamical systems whose state
probability densities can be represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our
goal is to compute optimal controllers that can ensure that the terminal state
distribution will match the desired distribution exactly (hard-constrained
version) or closely (soft-constrained version) where in the latter case we
employ a Wasserstein like metric that can measure the distance between
different GMMs. Our approach relies on a class of randomized control policies
which allow us to reformulate the proposed density steering problems as
finite-dimensional optimization problems, and in particular, linear and
bilinear programs. Additionally, we explore more general density steering
problems based on the approximation of general distributions by GMMs and
characterize bounds for the error between the terminal distribution under our
policy and the approximated GMM terminal state distribution. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through non-trivial numerical
experiments.

                                        <span>  Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management
and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing
efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success
of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than
$\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt{T} )$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O}
(\log T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming
(LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes a general framework that
improves upon the $\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt{T} )$ result when the LP dual problem
exhibits certain error bound conditions. For the first time, we show that
first-order learning algorithms achieve $o( \sqrt{T} )$ regret in the
continuous support setting and $\mathcal{O} (\log T)$ regret in the finite
support setting beyond the non-degeneracy assumption. Our results significantly
improve the state-of-the-art regret results and provide new insights for
sequential decision-making.

                                        <span>  The Douglas-Rachford algorithm is a classic splitting method for finding a
zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators. It has also been applied to
settings that involve one weakly and one strongly monotone operator. In this
work, we extend the Douglas-Rachford algorithm to address multioperator
inclusion problems involving $m$ ($m\geq 2$) weakly and strongly monotone
operators, reformulated as a two-operator inclusion in a product space. By
selecting appropriate parameters, we establish the convergence of the algorithm
to a fixed point, from which solutions can be extracted. Furthermore, we
illustrate its applicability to sum-of-$m$-functions minimization problems
characterized by weakly convex and strongly convex functions. For general
nonconvex problems in finite-dimensional spaces, comprising Lipschitz
continuously differentiable functions and a proper closed function, we provide
global subsequential convergence guarantees.

                                        <span>  We consider stochastic optimization problems with non-convex functional
constraints, such as those arising in trajectory generation, sparse
approximation, and robust classification. To this end, we put forth a recursive
momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. At
each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates
of the stochastic objective and the constraint functions, and solving the
resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to
track the gradient of the stochastic objective function, which contributes to
variance reduction and hence accelerates the algorithm convergence. A key
ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard
Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the
dual variables and hence obtain problem-dependent bounds on the rate at which
the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Remarkably, the proposed
algorithm achieves near-optimal stochastic first-order (SFO) complexity with
adaptive step sizes and optimal SFO complexity with non-adaptive step sizes at
par with that achieved by state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms
for solving unconstrained problems. As an example, we detail a
obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the
proposed algorithm and show that its performance is superior to that of the
existing algorithms used for trajectory optimization. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is also shown to be comparable to that of a specialized
sparse classification algorithm applied to a binary classification problem.

                                        <span>  Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in emerging machine
learning and signal processing problems such as hyper-parameter optimization,
image reconstruction, meta-learning, adversarial training, and reinforcement
learning. However, bilevel optimization problems are traditionally known to be
difficult to solve. Recent progress on bilevel algorithms mainly focuses on
bilevel optimization problems through the lens of the implicit-gradient method,
where the lower-level objective is either strongly convex or unconstrained. In
this work, we tackle a challenging class of bilevel problems through the lens
of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty
reformulation recovers the (local) solutions of the original bilevel problem.
Further, we propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent (PBGD) algorithm
and establish its finite-time convergence for the constrained bilevel problem
with lower-level constraints yet without lower-level strong convexity.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the efficiency of the
proposed PBGD algorithm.

                                        <span>  Matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design.
This is best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the
simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid
[Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a
matroid's computational properties. Yet, less is understood where parallel
algorithms are concerned. In response, we initiate the study of parallel
matroid optimization in the adaptive complexity model [BS18]. First, we
reexamine Bor\r{u}vka's classical minimum weight spanning tree algorithm
[Bor26b; Bor26a] in the abstract language of matroid theory, and identify a new
certificate of optimality for the basis of any matroid as a result. In
particular, a basis is optimal if and only if it contains the points of minimum
weight in every circuit of the dual matroid. Hence, we can witnesses whether
any specific point belongs to the optimal basis via a test for local optimality
in a circuit of the dual matroid, thereby revealing a general design paradigm
towards parallel matroid optimization. To instantiate this paradigm, we use the
special structure of a binary matroid to identify an optimization scheme with
low adaptivity. Here, our key technical step is reducing optimization to the
simpler task of basis search in the binary matroid, using only logarithmic
overhead of adaptive rounds of queries to independence oracles.
Consequentially, we compose our reduction with the parallel basis search method
of [KUW88] to obtain an algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary
matroid terminating in sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an
independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm for
matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive
complexity in the independence query model without assuming the matroid is
encoded by a graph.

distribution. The problem pertains to the performative prediction setting in
which a trained model can affect the outcome estimated by the model. Such
dependency creates a feedback loop that influences the stability of
optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present
the first study on performative prediction with smooth but possibly non-convex
loss. We analyze a greedy deployment scheme with SGD (SGD-GD). Note that in the
literature, SGD-GD is often studied with strongly convex loss. We first propose
the definition of stationary performative stable (SPS) solutions through
relaxing the popular performative stable condition. We then prove that SGD-GD
converges to a biased SPS solution in expectation. We consider two conditions
of sensitivity on the distribution shifts: (i) the sensitivity is characterized
by Wasserstein-1 distance and the loss is Lipschitz w.r.t.~data samples, or
(ii) the sensitivity is characterized by total variation (TV) divergence and
the loss is bounded. In both conditions, the bias levels are proportional to
the stochastic gradient's variance and sensitivity level. Our analysis is
extended to a lazy deployment scheme where models are deployed once per several
SGD updates, and we show that it converges to an SPS solution with reduced
bias. Numerical experiments corroborate our theories.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes an arc-search interior-point algorithm for the nonlinear
constrained optimization problem. The proposed algorithm uses the second-order
derivatives to construct a search arc that approaches the optimizer. Because
the arc stays in the interior set longer than any straight line, it is expected
that the scheme will generate a better new iterate than a line search method.
The computation of the second-order derivatives requires to solve the second
linear system of equations, but the coefficient matrix of the second linear
system of equations is the same as the first linear system of equations.
Therefore, the matrix decomposition obtained while solving the first linear
system of equations can be reused. In addition, most elements of the right-hand
side vector of the second linear system of equations are already computed when
the coefficient matrix is assembled. Therefore, the computation cost for
solving the second linear system of equations is insignificant and the benefit
of having a better search scheme is well justified. The convergence of the
proposed algorithm is established. Some preliminary test results are reported
to demonstrate the merit of the proposed algorithm.

important implications for applications. To achieve both guarantees and high
reconstruction quality, we propose learning a pixel-based ridge regularizer
with a data-dependent and spatially varying regularization strength. For this
architecture, we establish the existence of solutions to the associated
variational problem and the stability of its solution operator. Further, we
prove that the reconstruction forms a maximum-a-posteriori approach.
Simulations for biomedical imaging and material sciences demonstrate that the
approach yields high-quality reconstructions even if only a small
instance-specific training set is available.

tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate
the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and
the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the
corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for
the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as
the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable
parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control
strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error
upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio.
Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the
joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system.
By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative
error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's
efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a
multi-agent formation control example.

equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the
corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time
classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic
approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the
so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on
the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the
displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the
solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global
well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is
then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view
of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is
also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system
also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in
generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained.
Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on
the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to
the aforementioned uniform estimates.

maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based
strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making
algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial
satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning,
such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge,
thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in
the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov
decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal
maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is
applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the
problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a
non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low
Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based
collision avoidance techniques.

enabling those with limited mobility to maintain their hair-related identity.
We present MOE-Hair, a soft robot system that performs three hair-care tasks:
head patting, finger combing, and hair grasping. The system features a
tendon-driven soft robot end-effector (MOE) with a wrist-mounted RGBD camera,
leveraging both mechanical compliance for safety and visual force sensing
through deformation. In testing with a force-sensorized mannequin head, MOE
achieved comparable hair-grasping effectiveness while applying significantly
less force than rigid grippers. Our novel force estimation method combines
visual deformation data and tendon tensions from actuators to infer applied
forces, reducing sensing errors by up to 60.1% and 20.3% compared to actuator
current load-only and depth image-only baselines, respectively. A user study
with 12 participants demonstrated statistically significant preferences for
MOE-Hair over a baseline system in terms of comfort, effectiveness, and
appropriate force application. These results demonstrate the unique advantages
of soft robots in contact-rich hair-care tasks, while highlighting the
importance of precise force control despite the inherent compliance of the
system.

                                        <span>  Designing controllers that accomplish tasks while guaranteeing safety
constraints remains a significant challenge. We often want an agent to perform
well in a nominal task, such as environment exploration, while ensuring it can
avoid unsafe states and return to a desired target by a specific time. In
particular we are motivated by the setting of safe, efficient, hands-off
training for reinforcement learning in the real world. By enabling a robot to
safely and autonomously reset to a desired region (e.g., charging stations)
without human intervention, we can enhance efficiency and facilitate training.
Safety filters, such as those based on control barrier functions, decouple
safety from nominal control objectives and rigorously guarantee safety. Despite
their success, constructing these functions for general nonlinear systems with
control constraints and system uncertainties remains an open problem. This
paper introduces a safety filter obtained from the value function associated
with the reach-avoid problem. The proposed safety filter minimally modifies the
nominal controller while avoiding unsafe regions and guiding the system back to
the desired target set. By preserving policy performance while allowing safe
resetting, we enable efficient hands-off reinforcement learning and advance the
feasibility of safe training for real world robots. We demonstrate our approach
using a modified version of soft actor-critic to safely train a swing-up task
on a modified cartpole stabilization problem.

(ASD), playing a substantial role in the social and communicative challenges
that individuals with ASD face. This study explores the impacts of a
month-long, in-home intervention designed to promote triadic interactions
between a social robot, a child with ASD, and their caregiver. Our results
indicate that the intervention successfully promoted appropriate gaze behavior,
encouraging children with ASD to follow the robot's gaze, resulting in more
frequent and prolonged instances of spontaneous eye contact and joint attention
with their caregivers. Additionally, we observed specific timelines for
behavioral variability and novelty effects among users. Furthermore, diagnostic
measures for ASD emerged as strong predictors of gaze patterns for both
caregivers and children. These results deepen our understanding of ASD gaze
patterns and highlight the potential for clinical relevance of robot-assisted
interventions.

                                        <span>  Autonomous vehicles have gained significant attention due to technological
advancements and their potential to transform transportation. A critical
challenge in this domain is precise localization, particularly in LiDAR-based
map matching, which is prone to errors due to degeneracy in the data. Most
sensor fusion techniques, such as the Kalman filter, rely on accurate error
covariance estimates for each sensor to improve localization accuracy. However,
obtaining reliable covariance values for map matching remains a complex task.
To address this challenge, we propose a neural network-based framework for
predicting localization error covariance in LiDAR map matching. To achieve
this, we introduce a novel dataset generation method specifically designed for
error covariance estimation. In our evaluation using a Kalman filter, we
achieved a 2 cm improvement in localization accuracy, a significant enhancement
in this domain.

                                        <span>  Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making
and motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance,
especially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due
to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and
safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an
interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates
decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP),
considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians,
road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to
model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized
motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule
adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible
maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations
conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency,
robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared
against various baseline models. Our open-source project is available at

                                        <span>  While recent depth estimation methods exhibit strong zero-shot
generalization, achieving accurate metric depth across diverse camera
types-particularly those with large fields of view (FoV) such as fisheye and
360-degree cameras-remains a significant challenge. This paper presents Depth
Any Camera (DAC), a powerful zero-shot metric depth estimation framework that
extends a perspective-trained model to effectively handle cameras with varying
FoVs. The framework is designed to ensure that all existing 3D data can be
leveraged, regardless of the specific camera types used in new applications.
Remarkably, DAC is trained exclusively on perspective images but generalizes
seamlessly to fisheye and 360-degree cameras without the need for specialized
training data. DAC employs Equi-Rectangular Projection (ERP) as a unified image
representation, enabling consistent processing of images with diverse FoVs. Its
key components include a pitch-aware Image-to-ERP conversion for efficient
online augmentation in ERP space, a FoV alignment operation to support
effective training across a wide range of FoVs, and multi-resolution data
augmentation to address resolution disparities between training and testing.
DAC achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot metric depth estimation, improving
delta-1 ($\delta_1$) accuracy by up to 50% on multiple fisheye and 360-degree
datasets compared to prior metric depth foundation models, demonstrating robust
generalization across camera types.

fragile and confined environments. It allows the robot to exert minimal force
on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel
design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating
fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its
stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm
is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements,
allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on
surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were
conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under
different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies
significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This
highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate
environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ
inspection.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a novel method for open-vocabulary 3D scene querying in
autonomous driving by combining Language Embedded 3D Gaussians with Large
Language Models (LLMs). We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually
canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and
scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to
create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller,
more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on
the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation
significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical
phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable
to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through
ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words
correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage
additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement
towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively
bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while
maintaining practical deployment considerations.

                                        <span>  Autonomous selection of optimal options for data collection from multiple
alternatives is challenging in uncertain environments. When secondary
information about options is accessible, such problems can be framed as
contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). Neuro-inspired active inference has
gained interest for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation using
the expected free energy objective function. Unlike previous studies that
showed the effectiveness of active inference based strategy for CMABs using
synthetic data, this study aims to apply active inference to realistic
scenarios, using a simulated mineralogical survey site selection problem.
Hyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG at Cuprite, Nevada, serves as contextual
information for predicting outcome probabilities, while geologists' mineral
labels represent outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations assess the robustness of
active inference against changing expert preferences. Results show that active
inference requires fewer iterations than standard bandit approaches with
real-world noisy and biased data, and performs better when outcome preferences
vary online by adapting the selection strategy to align with expert shifts.

                                        <span>  We introduce a new variant of contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) called
observation-augmented CMABs (OA-CMABs) wherein a robot uses extra outcome
observations from an external information source, e.g. humans. In OA-CMABs,
external observations are a function of context features and thus provide
evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters.
However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve
the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian
inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic
semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model
parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for
semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in
OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option
selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This
generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty
observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for a simulated deep space
search site selection problem show that, even if incorrect semantic
observations are provided externally, e.g. by scientists, efficient
decision-making and robust parameter inference are still achieved in a wide
variety of conditions.

signals for training embodied agents to follow instructions, our research
reveals that agents guided by VLM rewards often underperform compared to those
employing only intrinsic (exploration-driven) rewards, contradicting
expectations set by recent work. We hypothesize that false positive rewards --
instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more
detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis,
revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false
positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary
{M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise.
BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging
embodied navigation environments. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of
how different types of reward noise impact agent learning and highlight the
importance of addressing multimodal reward signal noise when training embodied
agents

maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based
strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making
algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial
satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning,
such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge,
thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in
the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov
decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal
maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is
applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the
problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a
non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low
Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based
collision avoidance techniques.

training for reinforcement learning in the real world. By enabling a robot to
safely and autonomously reset to a desired region (e.g., charging stations)
without human intervention, we can enhance efficiency and facilitate training.
Safety filters, such as those based on control barrier functions, decouple
safety from nominal control objectives and rigorously guarantee safety. Despite
their success, constructing these functions for general nonlinear systems with
control constraints and system uncertainties remains an open problem. This
paper introduces a safety filter obtained from the value function associated
with the reach-avoid problem. The proposed safety filter minimally modifies the
nominal controller while avoiding unsafe regions and guiding the system back to
the desired target set. By preserving policy performance while allowing safe
resetting, we enable efficient hands-off reinforcement learning and advance the
feasibility of safe training for real world robots. We demonstrate our approach
using a modified version of soft actor-critic to safely train a swing-up task
on a modified cartpole stabilization problem.

                                        <span>  Extended reality (XR), blending virtual and real worlds, is a key application
of future networks. While AI advancements enhance XR capabilities, they also
impose significant computational and energy challenges on lightweight XR
devices. In this paper, we developed a distributed queue model for multi-task
DNN inference, addressing issues of resource competition and queue coupling. In
response to the challenges posed by the high energy consumption and limited
resources of XR devices, we designed a dual time-scale joint optimization
strategy for model partitioning and resource allocation, formulated as a
bi-level optimization problem. This strategy aims to minimize the total energy
consumption of XR devices while ensuring queue stability and adhering to
computational and communication resource constraints. To tackle this problem,
we devised a Lyapunov-guided Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, named
LyaPPO. Numerical results demonstrate that the LyaPPO algorithm outperforms the
baselines, achieving energy conservation of 24.79% to 46.14% under varying
resource capacities. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reduces the energy
consumption of XR devices by 24.29% to 56.62% compared to baseline algorithms.

applications, alongside a high-gain substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
antenna. The PCM elements are integrated into the antenna design in a
chessboard array configuration, with the goal of achieving effective reduction
in the antenna's radar cross section (RCS). Both the PCM elements and antenna
structure exhibit a simple design. The top layer of the metasurface (MS)
elements employs an elliptical pattern symmetric along the diagonal, enabling
efficient conversion of linearly polarized waves. The antenna component, on the
other hand, consists of a broadband dipole antenna fed by SIW slot coupling.
Verified through simulations, the polarization conversion bandwidth of this PCM
unit reaches 80.38% where polarization conversion ratio (PCR) exceeds 90%
(25.3-59.3GHz), demonstrating exceptional conversion performance. When the
dipole antenna is combined with the PCM, its -10dB impedance bandwidth reaches
to 15.09% (33.7-39.2GHz), with a maximum realized gain of 9.1dBi. Notably, the
antenna loaded with the chessboard PCM structure effectively disperses the
energy of scattered echoes around, significantly reducing the concentration of
scattered energy in the direction of the incident wave, thereby achieving an
effective reduction in RCS.

                                        <span>  Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making
and motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance,
especially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due
to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and
safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an
interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates
decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP),
considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians,
road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to
model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized
motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule
adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible
maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations
conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency,
robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared
against various baseline models. Our open-source project is available at

deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern
era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human
life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network
solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite
the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack
of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically,
technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and
contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web
applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa
networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client
devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of
the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver
devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the
aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and
responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and
contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the
application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length.
The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment,
and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and
~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

the FMRMC problem over the clique lifted graph is reducible to the FMRMC
problem over the base graph, while the optimal mixing times on both graphs are
identical. Based on this result and the solution of the semidefinite
programming formulation of the FMRMC problem, the problem has been addressed
over a wide variety of topologies with the same base graph. Second, the general
form of the FMRMC problem is addressed on stand-alone topologies as well as
subgraphs of an arbitrary graph. For subgraphs, it is shown that the optimal
transition probabilities over edges of the subgraph can be determined
independent of rest of the topology.

                                        <span>  Follow-the-leader (FTL) motion is essential for continuum robots operating in
fragile and confined environments. It allows the robot to exert minimal force
on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel
design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating
fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its
stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm
is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements,
allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on
surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were
conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under
different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies
significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This
highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate
environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ
inspection.

                                        <span>  We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate
the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed,
non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is
correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic
conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the
true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty
and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To
learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning
(COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using
Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the
conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance
improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the
steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We
present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations
show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing
environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current
reinforcement learning techniques.

                                        <span>  The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks
through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the
optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning
(ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention.
This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through
multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By
integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models,
SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for
multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise
in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to
specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth
process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for
InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi,
achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL)
intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work
highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address
challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable
materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy
facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process
repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth
parameters.

behaviour is exhibited to relax descent property and escape local minima.

While industry evidence highlights its vast market potential and economic and
environmental benefits, remanufacturing remains underexplored in theoretical
research. This study revisits a state-of-the-art remanufacture-to-order (RtO)
system and develops an alternative approach by developing an approximate
dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to solve larger RtO instances. The proposed
methodology yields results consistent with existing state-dependent,
non-congestive policies. Key findings include the optimality of fulfilling
demand whenever remanufacturable cores are available and prioritizing cores of
the highest quality level. This work highlights the potential of ADP in
addressing problems in remanufacturing domains.

                                        <span>  The objective of this work is to study the existence, uniqueness, and
stability of equilibria in mean field games involving a major player and a
continuum of minor players over finite intervals of arbitrary length. Following
earlier articles addressing similar questions in the context of classical mean
field games, the cost functions for the minor players are assumed to satisfy
the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition. In this contribution, we demonstrate
that if, in addition to the monotonicity condition, the intensity of the
(Brownian) noise driving the major player is sufficiently high, then -- under
further mild regularity assumptions on the coefficients -- existence,
uniqueness, and stability of equilibria are guaranteed. A key challenge is to
show that the threshold (beyond which the noise intensity must be taken) can be
chosen independently of the length of the time interval over which the game is
defined. Building on the stability properties thus established, we further show
that the associated system of master equations admits a unique classical
solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind
for major-minor mean field games defined over intervals of arbitrary length.

                                        <span>  We explore a multiple-stage variant of the min-max robust selection problem
with budgeted uncertainty that includes queries. First, one queries a subset of
items and gets the exact values of their uncertain parameters. Given this
information, one can then choose the set of items to be selected, still facing
uncertainty on the unobserved parameters. In this paper, we study two specific
variants of this problem. The first variant considers objective uncertainty and
focuses on selecting a single item. The second variant considers constraint
uncertainty instead, which means that some selected items may fail. We show
that both problems are NP-hard in general. We also propose polynomial-time
algorithms for special cases of the sets of items that can be queried. For the
problem with constraint uncertainty, we also show how the objective function
can be expressed as a linear program, leading to a mixed-integer linear
programming reformulation for the general case. We illustrate the performance
of this formulation using numerical experiments.

availability to minimize usage costs and is a recent project scheduling problem
variant. The Multi-Mode On-Site Workshop Availability Cost Problem (MOSWACP)
extends MRACP by introducing spatial constraints for On-site Workshops (OSWs)
at construction sites. MOSWACP aims to determine the optimal availability
level, installation, and dismantling times for OSWs while scheduling activities
within spatial and resource limitations. A novel Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) model is developed, and a metaheuristic algorithm, the
Electron Radar Search Algorithm (ERSA), is proposed to solve large-scale
instances. ERSA, enhanced with problem-specific operators, outperforms CPLEX in
large instances and outperforms Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm
(GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). An actual case study demonstrated
significant cost savings using the proposed model. The results and conclusions
highlight the effectiveness of the ERSA approach in managing complex project
scheduling challenges.

Rolle's Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem (MVT). These theorems play a crucial
role in the development of theoretical and practical results in mathematics,
serving as the basis for various applications in analysis and modeling of
real-world phenomena. Initially, we present the formal statements and their
respective analytical proofs, highlighting the mathematical rigor necessary for
understanding them. Additionally, we discuss the geometric interpretation of
both theorems, emphasizing their importance in understanding properties of
differentiable functions. The goal of this work is not only to validate these
theorems through analytical methods but also to perform their computational
verification, providing an integrated view between theory and practice.

                                        <span>  We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with an unknown
linear constraint using a membership oracle that, given a solution, determines
whether it is feasible or infeasible with absolute certainty. The goal of the
decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the
number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning based on Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), we adapt a classical framework in order to solve the problem
by learning and exploiting a surrogate linear constraint. The resulting new
framework includes training a linear separator on the labeled points and
selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling
strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active
learning literature, one can consider using SVM as a linear classifier and the
information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin. We improve on both
sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer
quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm
for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on the pure
knapsack problem and on a college study plan problem from the literature to
show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence
the quality of the results in terms of objective value.

                                        <span>  Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used algorithm for attributing the
outputs of a deep neural network to its input features. Due to the absence of
closed-form integrals for deep learning models, inaccurate Riemann Sum
approximations are used to calculate IG. This often introduces undesirable
errors in the form of high levels of noise, leading to false insights in the
model's decision-making process. We introduce a framework, RiemannOpt, that
minimizes these errors by optimizing the sample point selection for the Riemann
Sum. Our algorithm is highly versatile and applicable to IG as well as its
derivatives like Blur IG and Guided IG. RiemannOpt achieves up to 20%
improvement in Insertion Scores. Additionally, it enables its users to curtail
computational costs by up to four folds, thereby making it highly functional
for constrained environments.

optimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture
search, and meta-learning. A common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize
a hyper-objective that implicitly depends on the solution set of the
lower-level function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely used,
its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases where
the lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we first provide
hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary points of the
hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be intractable
for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable
nonconvex-nonconvex bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies
the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order
algorithm can achieve better complexity bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ in the deterministic, partially
stochastic, and fully stochastic setting respectively. The complexities in the
first two cases are optimal up to logarithmic factors.

                                        <span>  Low-altitude mobility, exemplified by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has
introduced transformative advancements across various domains, like
transportation, logistics, and agriculture. Leveraging flexible perspectives
and rapid maneuverability, UAVs extend traditional systems' perception and
action capabilities, garnering widespread attention from academia and industry.
However, current UAV operations primarily depend on human control, with only
limited autonomy in simple scenarios, and lack the intelligence and
adaptability needed for more complex environments and tasks. The emergence of
large language models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable problem-solving and
generalization capabilities, offering a promising pathway for advancing UAV
intelligence. This paper explores the integration of LLMs and UAVs, beginning
with an overview of UAV systems' fundamental components and functionalities,
followed by an overview of the state-of-the-art in LLM technology.
Subsequently, it systematically highlights the multimodal data resources
available for UAVs, which provide critical support for training and evaluation.
Furthermore, it categorizes and analyzes key tasks and application scenarios
where UAVs and LLMs converge. Finally, a reference roadmap towards agentic UAVs
is proposed, aiming to enable UAVs to achieve agentic intelligence through
autonomous perception, memory, reasoning, and tool utilization. Related

ViTacTip, which fulfills the demand for advanced multi-modal sensing in a
compact design. A notable feature of ViTacTip is its transparent skin, which
incorporates a `see-through-skin' mechanism. This mechanism aims at capturing
detailed object features upon contact, significantly improving both
vision-based and proximity perception capabilities. In parallel, the biomimetic
tips embedded in the sensor's skin are designed to amplify contact details,
thus substantially augmenting tactile and derived force perception abilities.
To demonstrate the multi-modal capabilities of ViTacTip, we developed a
multi-task learning model that enables simultaneous recognition of hardness,
material, and textures. To assess the functionality and validate the
versatility of ViTacTip, we conducted extensive benchmarking experiments,
including object recognition, contact point detection, pose regression, and
grating identification. To facilitate seamless switching between various
sensing modalities, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based
approach. This method enhances the applicability of the ViTacTip sensor across
diverse environments by enabling cross-modality interpretation.

                                        <span>  The ability to automatically encircle boundaries with mobile robots is
crucial for tasks such as border tracking and object enclosing. Previous
research has primarily focused on regular boundaries, often assuming that their
geometric equations are known in advance, which is not often the case in
practice. In this paper, we investigate a more general case and propose an
algorithm that addresses geometric irregularities of boundaries without
requiring prior knowledge of their analytical expressions. To achieve this, we
develop a Fourier-based curve fitting method for boundary approximation using
sampled points, enabling parametric characterization of general 2-D boundaries.
This approach allows star-shaped boundaries to be fitted into polar-angle-based
parametric curves, while boundaries of other shapes are handled through
decomposition. Then, we design a vector field (VF) to achieve the encirclement
of the parameterized boundary, wherein a polar radius error is introduced to
measure the robot's ``distance'' to the boundary. The controller is finally
synthesized using a control barrier function and quadratic programming to
mediate some potentially conflicting specifications: boundary encirclement,
obstacle avoidance, and limited actuation. In this manner, the VF-guided
reference control not only guides the boundary encircling action, but can also
be minimally modified to satisfy obstacle avoidance and input saturation
constraints. Simulations and experiments are presented to verify the
performance of our new method, which can be applied to mobile robots to perform
practical tasks such as cleaning chemical spills and environment monitoring.

processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through
both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude,

classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing
popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs
is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in
their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs
in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over
the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of
these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation
metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics,

controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not
only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control
methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a
unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1)
is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without
state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs
(i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time
setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and
real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source
seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results
indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the
literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved
convergence speed, and better handling of noise.

3D Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function to control roughness. By varying the fractal
dimension used in terrain generation across three different values, we generate
60 unique off-road terrains. We use gradient maps to categorize the roughness
of each terrain, consisting of low-, semi-, and high-roughness areas. To test
how the fractal dimension affects the difficulty of vehicle traversals, we
measure the success rates, vertical accelerations, pitch and roll rates, and
traversal times of an autonomous ground vehicle traversing 20 randomized
straight-line paths in each terrain. As we increase the fractal dimension from
2.3 to 2.45 and from 2.45 to 2.6, we find that the median area of low-roughness
terrain decreases 13.8% and 7.16%, the median area of semi-rough terrain
increases 11.7% and 5.63%, and the median area of high-roughness terrain
increases 1.54% and 3.33%, all respectively. We find that the median success
rate of the vehicle decreases 22.5% and 25% as the fractal dimension increases
from 2.3 to 2.45 and from 2.45 to 2.6, respectively. Successful traversal
results show that the median root-mean-squared vertical accelerations, median
root-mean-squared pitch and roll rates, and median traversal times all increase
with the fractal dimension.

                                        <span>  LiDAR-based SLAM is recognized as one effective method to offer localization
guidance in rough environments. However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods
suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components
relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This
deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this
article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose
estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed
Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward
location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of
consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the
location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a
parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a
spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate
the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the
motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and
effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several
keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current
scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale
factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In
various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method.
The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground
vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.

                                        <span>  Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental robotic manipulation tasks
and has been the subject of extensive research. However, swiftly teaching a
robot to grasp a novel target object in clutter remains challenging. This paper
attempts to address the challenge by leveraging object attributes that
facilitate recognition, grasping, and rapid adaptation to new domains. In this
work, we present an end-to-end encoder-decoder network to learn attribute-based
robotic grasping with data-efficient adaptation capability. We first pre-train
the end-to-end model with a variety of basic objects to learn generic attribute
representation for recognition and grasping. Our approach fuses the embeddings
of a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and
learns to predict instance grasping affordances. To train the joint embedding
space of visual and textual attributes, the robot utilizes object persistence
before and after grasping. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that
only uses basic objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel
objects in new environments. To further facilitate generalization, we propose
two adaptation methods, adversarial adaption and one-grasp adaptation.
Adversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder using augmented data of
unlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the overall end-to-end
model using augmented data from one grasp trial. Both adaptation methods are
data-efficient and considerably improve instance grasping performance.
Experimental results in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that our
approach achieves over 81% instance grasping success rate on unknown objects,
which outperforms several baselines by large margins.

                                        <span>  In this study, we introduce a novel MRI-compatible rotary series elastic
actuator module utilizing velocity-sourced ultrasonic motors for
force-controlled robots operating within MRI scanners. Unlike previous
MRI-compatible SEA designs, our module incorporates a transmission force
sensing series elastic actuator structure, with four off-the-shelf compression
springs strategically placed between the gearbox housing and the motor housing.
This design features a compact size, thus expanding possibilities for a wider
range of MRI robotic applications. To achieve precise torque control, we
develop a controller that incorporates a disturbance observer tailored for
velocity-sourced motors. This controller enhances the robustness of torque
control in our actuator module, even in the presence of varying external
impedance, thereby augmenting its suitability for MRI-guided medical
interventions. Experimental validation demonstrates the actuator's torque
control performance in both 3 Tesla MRI and non-MRI environments, achieving a
5% settling time of 0.05 seconds and a steady-state error within 2.5% of its
maximum output torque. Notably, our torque controller exhibits consistent
performance across low and high external impedance scenarios, in contrast to
conventional controllers for velocity-sourced series elastic actuators, which
struggle with steady-state performance under low external impedance conditions.

                                        <span>  The pursuit of agile and efficient underwater robots, especially bio-mimetic
robotic fish, has been impeded by challenges in creating motion controllers
that are able to fully exploit their hydrodynamic capabilities. This paper
addresses these challenges by introducing a novel, model-free, end-to-end
control framework that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enable
agile and energy-efficient swimming of robotic fish. Unlike existing methods
that rely on predefined trigonometric swimming patterns like Central Pattern
Generators (CPG), our approach directly outputs low-level actuator commands
without strong constraints, enabling the robotic fish to learn agile swimming
behaviors. In addition, by integrating a high-performance Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) simulator with innovative sim-to-real strategies, such as
normalized density calibration and servo response calibration, the proposed
framework significantly mitigates the sim-to-real gap, facilitating direct
transfer of control policies to real-world environments without fine-tuning.
Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster swimming
speeds, smaller turn-around radii, and reduced energy consumption compared to
the state-of-the-art swimming controllers. Furthermore, the proposed framework
shows promise in addressing complex tasks, paving the way for more effective
deployment of robotic fish in real aquatic environments.

                                        <span>  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms face the challenge of
efficient exploration due to the exponential increase in the size of the joint
state-action space. While demonstration-guided learning has proven beneficial
in single-agent settings, its direct applicability to MARL is hindered by the
practical difficulty of obtaining joint expert demonstrations. In this work, we
introduce a novel concept of personalized expert demonstrations, tailored for
each individual agent or, more broadly, each individual type of agent within a
heterogeneous team. These demonstrations solely pertain to single-agent
behaviors and how each agent can achieve personal goals without encompassing
any cooperative elements, thus naively imitating them will not achieve
cooperation due to potential conflicts. To this end, we propose an approach
that selectively utilizes personalized expert demonstrations as guidance and
allows agents to learn to cooperate, namely personalized expert-guided MARL
(PegMARL). This algorithm utilizes two discriminators: the first provides
incentives based on the alignment of individual agent behavior with
demonstrations, and the second regulates incentives based on whether the
behaviors lead to the desired outcome. We evaluate PegMARL using personalized
demonstrations in both discrete and continuous environments. The experimental
results demonstrate that PegMARL outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms
in solving coordinated tasks, achieving strong performance even when provided
with suboptimal personalized demonstrations. We also showcase PegMARL's
capability of leveraging joint demonstrations in the StarCraft scenario and
converging effectively even with demonstrations from non-co-trained policies.

                                        <span>  It is challenging for the mobile robot to achieve autonomous and mapless
navigation in the unknown environment with uneven terrain. In this study, we
present a layered and systematic pipeline. At the local level, we maintain a
tree structure that is dynamically extended with the navigation. This structure
unifies the planning with the terrain identification. Besides, it contributes
to explicitly identifying the hazardous areas on uneven terrain. In particular,
certain nodes of the tree are consistently kept to form a sparse graph at the
global level, which records the history of the exploration. A series of
subgoals that can be obtained in the tree and the graph are utilized for
leading the navigation. To determine a subgoal, we develop an evaluation method
whose input elements can be efficiently obtained on the layered structure. We
conduct both simulation and real-world experiments to evaluate the developed
method and its key modules. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The robot can travel through the
unknown uneven region safely and reach the target rapidly without a
preconstructed map.

                                        <span>  In non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite communication systems,
effectively utilizing beam hopping (BH) technology is crucial for addressing
uneven traffic demands. However, optimizing beam scheduling and resource
allocation in multi-NGSO BH scenarios remains a significant challenge. This
paper proposes a multi-NGSO BH algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) to optimize beam illumination patterns and power allocation. By
leveraging three degrees of freedom (i.e., time, space, and power), the
algorithm aims to optimize the long-term throughput and the long-term
cumulative average delay (LTCAD). The solution is based on proximal policy
optimization (PPO) with a hybrid action space combining discrete and continuous
actions. Using two policy networks with a shared base layer, the proposed
algorithm jointly optimizes beam scheduling and power allocation. One network
selects beam illumination patterns in the discrete action space, while the
other manages power allocation in the continuous space. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces LTCAD while maintaining high
throughput in time-varying traffic scenarios. Compared to the four benchmark
methods, it improves network throughput by up to $8.9\%$ and reduces LTCAD by
up to $69.2\%$

                                        <span>  There are many notions of symmetry for state space models. They play a role
in understanding when systems are time reversible, provide a system theoretic
interpretation of thermodynamics, and have applications in certain
stabilization and optimal control problems. The earliest form of symmetry for
analytic input-output systems is due to Fliess who introduced systems described
by an exchangeable generating series. In this case, one is able to write the
output as a memoryless analytic function of the integral of each input. The
first goal of this paper is to describe two new types of symmetry for such
Chen--Fliess input-output systems, namely, coefficient reversible symmetry and
palindromic symmetry. Each concept is then related to the notion of an
exchangeable series. The second goal of the paper is to provide an in-depth
analysis of Chen--Fliess input-output systems whose generating series are
linear time-varying, palindromic, and have generating series coefficients
growing at a maximal rate while ensuring some type of convergence. It is shown
that such series have an infinite Hankel rank and Lie rank, have a certain
infinite dimensional state space realization, and a description of their
relative degree and zero dynamics is given.

                                        <span>  Designing multi-agent systems with safety constraints and uncertain dynamics
is a challenging problem. This paper studies a stochastic dynamic
non-cooperative game with coupling safety chance constraints. The uncertainty
is assumed to satisfy a concentration of measure property. Firstly, due to the
non-convexity of chance constraints, a convex under-approximation of chance
constraints is given using constraints on the expectation. Then, the conditions
for the existence of the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) of the
under-approximated game are investigated, and the relation between the
$\varepsilon-$SGNE of the original game and the under-approximated one is
derived. A sampling-based algorithm is proposed for the SGNE seeking of the
under-approximated game that does not require knowing the distribution of the
uncertainty nor the analytical computation of expectations. Finally, under some
assumptions on the game's pseudo-gradient mapping, the almost sure convergence
of the algorithm to SGNE is proven. A numerical study is carried out on
demand-side management in microgrids with shared battery to demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed scheme.

                                        <span>  This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive
analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their
implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In
control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered
submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and
addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be
compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms
fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required
properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov
function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even
destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with
regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical
problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control
engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should
indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The
major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in
analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which
explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite
precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous
works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization,
approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories,
measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's
theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.

                                        <span>  The ability to automatically encircle boundaries with mobile robots is
crucial for tasks such as border tracking and object enclosing. Previous
research has primarily focused on regular boundaries, often assuming that their
geometric equations are known in advance, which is not often the case in
practice. In this paper, we investigate a more general case and propose an
algorithm that addresses geometric irregularities of boundaries without
requiring prior knowledge of their analytical expressions. To achieve this, we
develop a Fourier-based curve fitting method for boundary approximation using
sampled points, enabling parametric characterization of general 2-D boundaries.
This approach allows star-shaped boundaries to be fitted into polar-angle-based
parametric curves, while boundaries of other shapes are handled through
decomposition. Then, we design a vector field (VF) to achieve the encirclement
of the parameterized boundary, wherein a polar radius error is introduced to
measure the robot's ``distance'' to the boundary. The controller is finally
synthesized using a control barrier function and quadratic programming to
mediate some potentially conflicting specifications: boundary encirclement,
obstacle avoidance, and limited actuation. In this manner, the VF-guided
reference control not only guides the boundary encircling action, but can also
be minimally modified to satisfy obstacle avoidance and input saturation
constraints. Simulations and experiments are presented to verify the
performance of our new method, which can be applied to mobile robots to perform
practical tasks such as cleaning chemical spills and environment monitoring.

                                        <span>  For servers incorporating parallel computing resources, batching is a pivotal
technique for providing efficient and economical services at scale. Parallel
computing resources exhibit heightened computational and energy efficiency when
operating with larger batch sizes. However, in the realm of online services,
the adoption of a larger batch size may lead to longer response times. This
paper aims to provide a dynamic batching scheme that delicately balances
latency and efficiency. The system is modeled as a batch service queue with
size-dependent service times. Then, the design of dynamic batching is
formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem, with the objective
of minimizing the weighted sum of average response time and average power
consumption. A method is proposed to derive an approximate optimal SMDP
solution, representing the chosen dynamic batching policy. By introducing an
abstract cost to reflect the impact of "tail" states, the space complexity and
the time complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%,
respectively. Numerical results showcase the superiority of SMDP-based batching
policies across various parameter setups. Additionally, the proposed scheme
exhibits noteworthy flexibility in balancing power consumption and latency.

spring-augmented chassis and proprioceptive state awareness, designed to endure
collisions and maintain smooth contact. We develop a fast-converging external
force estimation algorithm for XPLORER that leverages onboard sensors and
proprioceptive data for contact and collision detection. Using this force
information, we propose four motion primitives, including three novel
tactile-based primitives: tactile-traversal, tactile-turning, and
ricocheting-to aid XPLORER in navigating unknown environments. These primitives
are synthesized autonomously in real-time to enable efficient exploration and
navigation by leveraging collisions and contacts. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the potential of
passive deformable UAVs for contact-rich real-world tasks such as
non-destructive inspection, surveillance and mapping, and pursuit/evasion.

                                        <span>  Assembly is a key industrial process to achieve finished goods. Driven by
market demographics and technological advancements, industrial assembly has
evolved through several phases i.e. craftmanship, bench assembly, assembly
lines and flexible assembly cells. Due to the complexity and variety of
assembly tasks, besides significant advancement of automation technologies in
other manufacturing activities, humans are still considered vital for assembly
operations. The rationalization of manufacturing automation has considerably
remained away from assembly systems. The advancement in assembly has only been
in terms of better scheduling of work tasks and avoiding of wastes. With smart
manufacturing technologies such as collaborative robots, additive
manufacturing, and digital twins, the opportunities have arisen for the next
reshaping of assembly systems. The new paradigm promises a higher degree of
automation yet remaining flexible. This may result into a new manufacturing
paradigm driven by the advancement of new technologies, new customer
expectations and by establishing new kinds of manufacturing systems. This study
explores the future collaborative assembly cells, presents a generic framework
to develop them and the basic building blocks.

                                        <span>  In a uniformly hyperbolic system, we consider the problem of finding the
optimal infinitesimal perturbation to apply to the system, from a certain set
$P$ of feasible ones, to maximally increase the expectation of a given
observation function. We perturb the system both by composing with a
diffeomorphism near the identity or by adding a deterministic perturbation to
the dynamics. In both cases, using the fast adjoint response formula, we show
that the linear response operator, which associates the response of the
expectation to the perturbation on the dynamics, is bounded in terms of the
$C^{1,\alpha}$ norm of the perturbation. Under the assumption that $P$ is a
strictly convex, closed subset of a Hilbert space $\cH$ that can be
continuously mapped in the space of $C^3$ vector fields on our phase space, we
show that there is a unique optimal perturbation in $P$ that maximizes the
increase of the given observation function. Furthermore since the response
operator is represented by a certain element $v$ of $\cH$, when the feasible
set $P$ is the unit ball of $\cH$, the optimal perturbation is $v/||v||_{\cH}$.
We also show how to compute the Fourier expansion $v$ in different cases. Our
approach can work even on high dimensional systems. We demonstrate our method
on numerical examples in dimensions 2, 3, and 21.

distinguished class of Lorentzian polynomials. As shown in \cite{GPlorentzian},
the set of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials is equivalent to the set of
$\K$-completely log-concave (aka $\K$-CLC) forms. Throughout this paper, we
interchangeably use the terms $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials for the homogeneous
setting and $\K$-CLC polynomials for the non-homogeneous setting. By
introducing an alternative definition of $\K$-CLC polynomials through
univariate restrictions, we establish that any strictly $\K$-CLC polynomial of
degree $d \leq 4$ is Hurwitz-stable polynomial over $\K$. Additionally, we
characterize the conditions under which a strictly $\K$-CLC of degree $d \geq
5$ is Hurwitz-stable over $\K$. Furthermore, we associate the largest possible
proper cone, denoted by $\K(f,v)$, with a given $\K$-Lorentzian polynomial $f$
in the direction $v \in \inter \K$. Finally, we investigate applications of
$\K$-CLC polynomials in the stability analysis of evolution variational
inequalities (EVI) dynamical systems governed by differential equations and
inequality constraints.

bounded by $\Delta$ in absolute value. Cook et al.~(1986) have shown that there
exists a universal matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{m' \times n}$ with the following
property: For each $b \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, there exists $t \in \mathbb{Z}^{m'}$
such that the integer hull of the polyhedron $P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon
Ax \leq b\}$ is described by $P_I = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Bx \leq t\}$.
Our \emph{main result} is that $t$ is an \emph{affine} function of $b$ as long
as $b$ is from a fixed equivalence class of the lattice $D \cdot \mathbb{Z}^m$.
Here $D \in \mathbb{N}$ is a number that depends on $n$ and $\Delta$ only.
Furthermore, $D$ as well as the matrix $B$ can be computed in time depending on
$\Delta$ and $n$ only. An application of this result is the solution of an open
problem posed by Cslovjecsek et al.~(SODA 2024) concerning the complexity of
\emph{2-stage-stochastic integer programming} problems. The main tool of our
proof is the classical theory of \emph{Gomory-Chv\'atal cutting planes} and the
\emph{elementary closure} of rational polyhedra.

operator with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions respectively of a
bounded plane domain $\Omega$. We prove that, without any particular assumption
on the class of open sets $\Omega$, the two classical inequalities (the
Faber-Krahn inequality and the Weinberger inequality) provide a complete system
of inequalities. Then we consider the case of convex plane domains for which we
give new inequalities for the product $\lambda_1 \mu_1$. We plot the so-called
Blaschke--Santal\'o diagram and give some conjectures.

the perimeter $P$, the area $|\cdot|$ and the Cheeger constant $h$ of planar
sets. To do so, we study the so called Blaschke--Santal\'o diagram of the
triplet $(P,h,|\cdot|)$ for different classes of domains: simply connected
sets, convex sets and convex polygons with at most $N$ sides. We completely
determine the diagram in the latter cases except for the class of convex
$N$-gons when $N\ge 5$ is odd: therein, we show that the boundary of the
diagram is given by the graphs of two continuous and strictly increasing
functions. An explicit formula for the lower one and a numerical method to
obtain the upper one is provided. At last, some applications of the results are
presented.

                                        <span>  This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive
analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their
implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In
control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered
submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and
addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be
compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms
fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required
properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov
function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even
destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with
regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical
problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control
engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should
indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The
major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in
analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which
explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite
precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous
works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization,
approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories,
measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's
theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.

minimization, where the first part of the objective is the ratio of a
nonnegative nonsmooth nonconvex function to a nonnegative nonsmooth convex
function, while the second part is the difference of a smooth nonconvex
function and a nonsmooth convex function. This model problem has many important
applications, for example, the scale-invariant sparse signal recovery in signal
processing. However, the existing methods for fractional programs are not
suitable for solving this problem due to its special structure. We first
present a novel nonfractional min-max reformulation for the original fractional
program and show the connections between their global (local) optimal solutions
and stationary points. Based on the reformulation, we propose an alternating
maximization proximal descent algorithm and show its subsequential convergence
towards a critical point of the original fractional program under a mild
assumption. By further assuming the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property of an
auxiliary function, we also establish the convergence of the entire solution
sequence generated by the proposed algorithm. Finally, some numerical
experiments on the scale-invariant sparse signal recovery are conducted to
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

                                        <span>  Community-based graph clustering is one of the most popular topics in the
analysis of complex social networks. This type of clustering involves grouping
vertices that are considered to share more connections, whereas vertices in
different groups share fewer connections. A successful clustering result forms
densely connected induced subgraphs. This paper studies a specific form of
graph clustering problems that can be formulated as semi-assignment problems,
where the objective function exhibits block properties. We reformulate these
problems as sparse-constrained optimization problems and relax them to
continuous optimization models. We apply a quadratic penalty method to the
relaxation problem and solve the nonlinear quadratic penalty subproblem with
simple box constraints using a projected gradient method based on the active
set. Extensive numerical results indicate that our method provides more
accurate clustering results for solving graph clustering problems at a faster
speed, both for synthetic graphs and real-world network datasets, particularly
in large-scale cases.

controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not
only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control
methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a
unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1)
is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without
state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs
(i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time
setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and
real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source
seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results
indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the
literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved
convergence speed, and better handling of noise.

                                        <span>  This paper deals with nonconvex optimization problems via a two-level
smoothing framework in which the high-order Moreau envelope (HOME) is applied
to generate a smooth approximation of weakly convex cost functions. As such,
the differentiability and weak smoothness of HOME are further studied, as is
necessary for developing inexact first-order methods for finding its critical
points. Building on the concept of the inexact two-level smoothing optimization
(ItsOPT), the proposed scheme offers a versatile setting, called Inexact
two-level smoothing DEscent ALgorithm (ItsDEAL), for developing inexact
first-order methods: (i) solving the proximal subproblem approximately to
provide an inexact first-order oracle of HOME at the lower-level; (ii)
developing an upper inexact first-order method at the upper-level. In
particular, parameter-free inexact descent methods (i.e., dynamic step-sizes
and an inexact nonmonotone Armijo line search) are studied that effectively
leverage the weak smooth property of HOME. Although the subsequential
convergence of these methods is investigated under some mild inexactness
assumptions, the global convergence and the linear rates are studied under the
extra Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (KL) property. In order to validate the
theoretical foundation, preliminary numerical experiments for robust sparse
recovery problems are provided which reveal a promising behavior of the
proposed methods.

                                        <span>  Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are powerful tools for tackling complex
computational problems, yet effectively managing the exploitation and
exploration dynamics -- crucial for robust search navigation -- remains a
persistent challenge for EA designers, and leads to the so-called
exploration-exploitation dilemma. In this paper, a new human-centered framework
is proposed to resolve this dilemma. Unlike the traditional approach, the
search process will not be compromised of a single-phase nor the decision-maker
tuning efforts will be distributed among the algorithm's traditional parameters
such as defining new evolutionary operators internal to the algorithm to
influence its search navigation. Instead, a human-centered two-phase search
process, compromised of a global search phase followed by a local phase will be
utilized. In this framework, the designer plays the central role in directing
the algorithm's search navigation through the focused tuning efforts of a new
Search Space Size Control parameter external to the algorithm which proves
itself to be the dominant parameter in-effect to the algorithm's effective
search navigation.
  The framework is applicable to any search algorithm. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on 14 well-known benchmark problems in unconstrained
optimization.

nonsmooth unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in
finite-dimensional spaces. The established conditions are expressed in terms of
second-order subdifferentials of lower semicontinuous functions and mainly
concern prox-regular objectives that cover a large territory in nonsmooth

variational analysis and second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained
general results are applied to problems of nonlinear programming, where the
derived second-order optimality conditions are new even for problems with twice

Transition) model for energy systems planning with the following novelties: (1)
integrating capacity expansion, retrofit and abandonment planning, and (2)
using multi-horizon stochastic mixed-integer linear programming with
multi-timescale uncertainty. We apply the model to the European energy system
considering: (a) investment in new hydrogen infrastructures, (b) capacity
expansion of the European power system, (c) retrofitting oil and gas
infrastructures in the North Sea region for hydrogen production and
distribution, and abandoning existing infrastructures, and (d) long-term
uncertainty in oil and gas prices and short-term uncertainty in time series
parameters. We utilise the structure of multi-horizon stochastic programming
and propose a stabilised adaptive Benders decomposition to solve the model
efficiently. We first conduct a sensitivity analysis on retrofitting costs of
oil and gas infrastructures. We then compare the REORIENT model with a
conventional investment planning model regarding costs and investment
decisions. Finally, the computational performance of the algorithm is
presented. The results show that: (1) when the retrofitting cost is below 20%
of the cost of building new ones, retrofitting is economical for most of the
existing pipelines, (2) platform clusters keep producing oil due to the massive
profit, and the clusters are abandoned in the last investment stage, (3)
compared with a traditional investment planning model, the REORIENT model
yields 24% lower investment cost in the North Sea region, and (4) the enhanced
Benders algorithm is up to 6.8 times faster than the level method stabilised
adaptive Benders.

                                        <span>  The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower
dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on
an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly
limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a
decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent
space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach
eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via
the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal
accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant,
approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence.
To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss
minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our
method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is
crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this
work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows,
where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this

generation specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks. EnerVerse
seamlessly integrates convolutional and bidirectional attention mechanisms for
inner-chunk space modeling, ensuring low-level consistency and continuity.
Recognizing the inherent redundancy in video data, we propose a sparse memory
context combined with a chunkwise unidirectional generative paradigm to enable
the generation of infinitely long sequences. To further augment robotic
capabilities, we introduce the Free Anchor View (FAV) space, which provides
flexible perspectives to enhance observation and analysis. The FAV space
mitigates motion modeling ambiguity, removes physical constraints in confined
environments, and significantly improves the robot's generalization and
adaptability across various tasks and settings. To address the prohibitive
costs and labor intensity of acquiring multi-camera observations, we present a
data engine pipeline that integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian
Splatting (4DGS). This pipeline leverages the generative model's robust
generalization capabilities and the spatial constraints provided by 4DGS,
enabling an iterative enhancement of data quality and diversity, thus creating
a data flywheel effect that effectively narrows the sim-to-real gap. Finally,
our experiments demonstrate that the embodied future space generation prior
substantially enhances policy predictive capabilities, resulting in improved
overall performance, particularly in long-range robotic manipulation tasks.

transport mobility in terms of safety, reliability, and decarbonization.
However, ensuring safety and efficiency in interactive during within dynamic
and diverse environments is still a primary barrier to large-scale AV adoption.
In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an advanced
AI-based approach, enabling AVs to learn decision-making strategies adaptively
from data and interactions. DRL strategies are better suited than traditional
rule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving
environments due to their adaptivity. However, varying driving scenarios
present distinct challenges, such as avoiding obstacles on highways and
reaching specific exits at intersections, requiring different scenario-specific
decision-making algorithms. Many DRL algorithms have been proposed in
interactive decision-making. However, a rationale review of these DRL
algorithms across various scenarios is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive
evaluation is essential to assess these algorithms from multiple perspectives,
including those of vehicle users and vehicle manufacturers. This survey reviews
the application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical
scenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios
include highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections.
Furthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale
criteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency,
unselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI). Each criterion of DDTUI is
specifically analyzed in relation to the reviewed algorithms. Finally, the
challenges for future DRL-based decision-making algorithms are summarized.

                                        <span>  Path planning is essential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as it
determines the path that the UAV needs to follow to complete a task. This work
addresses this problem by introducing a new algorithm called navigation
variable-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (NMOPSO). It first
models path planning as an optimization problem via the definition of a set of
objective functions that include optimality and safety requirements for UAV
operation. The NMOPSO is then used to minimize those functions through Pareto
optimal solutions. The algorithm features a new path representation based on
navigation variables to include kinematic constraints and exploit the
maneuverable characteristics of the UAV. It also includes an adaptive mutation
mechanism to enhance the diversity of the swarm for better solutions.
Comparisons with various algorithms have been carried out to benchmark the
proposed approach. The results indicate that the NMOPSO performs better than
not only other particle swarm optimization variants but also other
state-of-the-art multi-objective and metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
Experiments have also been conducted with real UAVs to confirm the validity of
the approach for practical flights. The source code of the algorithm is
available at https://github.com/ngandng/NMOPSO.

                                        <span>  When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety
does no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value.
Conventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to
re-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which,
however, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of
managing runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of
the authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing
literature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to
recover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the
system's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to
modify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame
the reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM)
based Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution
derivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method
in terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the
results show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM
based Newton's method) $\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than
the OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our
method over the OCR method is $40.81\%$ without considering the deadline of run
time. The success rate remains at $49.44\%$ for the proposed method, while it
becomes $0\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \; seconds$ is
imposed.

enable interior spaces to physically transform in a bidirectional interaction
with occupants. Yet, it is still unknown how this interaction could unfold in
an understandable way. Inspired by HRI studies where robotic furniture gestured
intents to occupants by deliberately positioning or moving in space, we
hypothesise that adaptive architecture could also convey intents through
gestures performed by a mobile robotic partition. To explore this design space,
we invited 15 multidisciplinary experts to join co-design improvisation
sessions, where they manually manoeuvred a deactivated robotic partition to
design gestures conveying six architectural intents that varied in purpose and
urgency. Using a gesture elicitation method alongside motion-tracking data, a
Laban-based questionnaire, and thematic analysis, we identified 20 unique
gestural strategies. Through categorisation, we introduced architectonic
gestures as a novel strategy for robotic furniture to convey intent by
indexically leveraging its spatial impact, complementing the established
deictic and emblematic gestures. Our study thus represents an exploratory step
toward making the autonomous gestures of adaptive architecture more legible. By
understanding how robotic gestures are interpreted based not only on their
motion but also on their spatial impact, we contribute to bridging HRI with
Human-Building Interaction research.

                                        <span>  Unstructured environments such as mountains, caves, construction sites, or
disaster areas are challenging for autonomous navigation because of terrain
irregularities. In particular, it is crucial to plan a path to avoid risky
terrain and reach the goal quickly and safely. In this paper, we propose a
method for safe and distance-efficient path planning, leveraging Traversal Risk
Graph (TRG), a novel graph representation that takes into account geometric
traversability of the terrain. TRG nodes represent stability and reachability
of the terrain, while edges represent relative traversal risk-weighted path
candidates. Additionally, TRG is constructed in a wavefront propagation manner
and managed hierarchically, enabling real-time planning even in large-scale
environments. Lastly, we formulate a graph optimization problem on TRG that
leads the robot to navigate by prioritizing both safe and short paths. Our
approach demonstrated superior safety, distance efficiency, and fast processing
time compared to the conventional methods. It was also validated in several
real-world experiments using a quadrupedal robot. Notably, TRG-planner
contributed as the global path planner of an autonomous navigation framework
for the DreamSTEP team, which won the Quadruped Robot Challenge at ICRA 2023.

                                        <span>  Autonomous robotic grasping of uncertain objects in uncertain environments is
an impactful open challenge for the industries of the future. One such industry
is the recycling of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) materials,
in which electric devices are disassembled and readied for the recovery of raw
materials. Since devices may contain hazardous materials and their disassembly
involves heavy manual labor, robotic disassembly is a promising venue. However,
since devices may be damaged, dirty and unidentified, robotic disassembly is
challenging since object models are unavailable or cannot be relied upon. This
case study explores grasping strategies for industrial robotic disassembly of
WEEE devices with uncertain vision data. We propose three grippers and
appropriate tactile strategies for force-based manipulation that improves
grasping robustness. For each proposed gripper, we develop corresponding
strategies that can perform effectively in different grasping tasks and
leverage the grippers design and unique strengths. Through experiments
conducted in lab and factory settings for four different WEEE devices, we
demonstrate how object uncertainty may be overcome by tactile sensing and
compliant techniques, significantly increasing grasping success rates.

computationally demanding due to the need to identify, verify, and process
numerous candidate pairs to establish edge connections for the pose graph
optimization. Keyframe sampling mitigates this by reducing the number of frames
stored and processed in the back-end system. In this article, we address the
gap in optimized keyframe sampling for the combined problem of pose graph
optimization and loop closure detection. Our Minimal Subset Approach (MSA)
employs an optimization strategy with two key factors, redundancy minimization
and information preservation, within a sliding window framework to efficiently
reduce redundant keyframes, while preserving essential information. This method
delivers comparable performance to baseline approaches, while enhancing
scalability and reducing computational overhead. Finally, we evaluate MSA on
relevant publicly available datasets, showcasing that it consistently performs
across a wide range of environments, without requiring any manual parameter
tuning.

inertial sensors is a growing area with numerous real-world applications.
However, precise calibration of the time offset between these two sensor types
is a prerequisite for accurate and robust tracking. To address this, we propose
a universal online temporal calibration strategy for optimization-based
visual-inertial navigation systems. Technically, we incorporate the time offset
td as a state parameter in the optimization residual model to align the IMU
state to the corresponding image timestamp using td, angular velocity and
translational velocity. This allows the temporal misalignment td to be
optimized alongside other tracking states during the process. As our method
only modifies the structure of the residual model, it can be applied to various
optimization-based frameworks with different tracking frontends. We evaluate
our calibration method with both EuRoC and simulation data and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate time offset
estimation and faster convergence, particularly in the presence of noisy sensor
data.

RGB images through a prediction-update framework. Cloth-Splatting leverages an
action-conditioned dynamics model for predicting future states and uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to update the predicted states. Our key insight is that
coupling a 3D mesh-based representation with Gaussian Splatting allows us to
define a differentiable map between the cloth state space and the image space.
This enables the use of gradient-based optimization techniques to refine
inaccurate state estimates using only RGB supervision. Our experiments
demonstrate that Cloth-Splatting not only improves state estimation accuracy
over current baselines but also reduces convergence time.

model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously
collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model
expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially.
However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model.
Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's
fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this
issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone
coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information.
This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due
to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception
generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other
hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception
head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization
Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the
convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate
posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current
optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within
10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves
the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to

satellite performing relative proximity operations with an observer satellite.
The absolute and relative translation and attitude equations of motion for the
satellite pair are modeled using dual quaternions. The observability of the
relative dual quaternion system is analyzed using empirical observability
Gramian methods. The optimal placement of a fiducial marker set, in which each
marker gives simultaneous optical range and attitude measurements, is
determined for the pair of satellites. A geostationary flyby between the
observing body (chaser) and desired (target) satellites is numerically
simulated and the optimal fiducial placement sets of five and ten on the
surface of the desired satellite are solved. It is shown that the optimal
solution maximizes the distance between fiducial markers and selects marker
locations that are most sensitive to measuring changes in the state during the
nonlinear trajectory, despite being visible for less time than other candidate
marker locations. Definitions and properties of quaternions and dual
quaternions, and parallels between the two, are presented alongside the
relative motion model.

complex tasks like humans. However, there is still a large gap between
open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we
focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via
instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus
exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to
generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting
errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We
analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several
manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They
struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but
just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight,
we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to
enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the
trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass
a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its
error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization
ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing
perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings
establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and
provide a new paradigm for future research.

accurately learning the underlying rewards in both discrete and continuous
domains from behavior data. The next advance is to learn {\em intrinsic}
preferences in ways that produce useful behavior in settings or tasks which are
different but aligned with the observed ones. In the context of robotic
applications, this helps integrate robots into processing lines involving new
tasks (with shared intrinsic preferences) without programming from scratch. We
introduce a method to inversely learn an abstract reward function from behavior
trajectories in two or more differing instances of a domain. The abstract
reward function is then used to learn task behavior in another separate
instance of the domain. This step offers evidence of its transferability and
validates its correctness. We evaluate the method on trajectories in tasks from
multiple domains in OpenAI's Gym testbed and AssistiveGym and show that the
learned abstract reward functions can successfully learn task behaviors in
instances of the respective domains, which have not been seen previously.

crucial for learning from demonstrations. In this field, teleoperation faces
several key challenges: user-friendliness for new users, safety assurance, and
transferability across different platforms. While collecting real robot
dexterous manipulation data by teleoperation to train robots has shown
impressive results on diverse tasks, due to the morphological differences
between human and robot hands, it is not only hard for new users to understand
the action mapping but also raises potential safety concerns during operation.
To address these limitations, we introduce TelePreview. This teleoperation
system offers real-time visual feedback on robot actions based on human user
inputs, with a total hardware cost of less than $1,000. TelePreview allows the
user to see a virtual robot that represents the outcome of the user's next
movement. By enabling flexible switching between command visualization and
actual execution, this system helps new users learn how to demonstrate quickly
and safely. We demonstrate that it outperforms other teleoperation systems
across five tasks, emphasize its ease of use, and highlight its straightforward
deployment across diverse robotic platforms. We release our code and a
deployment document on our website https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/telepreview/.

(e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and
robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the
majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered
reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor
provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under
potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the
Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS,
to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing
trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while
considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the
estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes
1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output
distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time
series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by
additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to
calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module
in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and
testing data.

information is crucial for interaction-aware robots in dynamic environments.
Nevertheless, creating such a representation poses challenges due to sensor
noise, instance segmentation and tracking errors, and the objects' dynamic
motion. This paper introduces a novel particle-based instance-aware semantic
occupancy map to tackle these challenges. Particles with an augmented instance
state are used to estimate the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) of the
objects and implicitly model the environment. Utilizing a State-augmented
Sequential Monte Carlo PHD (S$^2$MC-PHD) filter, these particles are updated to
jointly estimate occupancy status, semantic, and instance IDs, mitigating
noise. Additionally, a memory module is adopted to enhance the map's
responsiveness to previously observed objects. Experimental results on the
Virtual KITTI 2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics under different noise
conditions. Subsequent tests using real-world data further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

                                        <span>  Exploration of the lunar south pole with a solar-powered rover is challenging
due to the highly dynamic solar illumination conditions and the presence of
permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). In turn, careful planning in space and
time is essential. Mission-level path planning is a global, spatiotemporal
paradigm that addresses this challenge, taking into account rover resources and
mission requirements. However, existing approaches do not proactively account
for random disturbances, such as recurring faults, that may temporarily delay
rover traverse progress. In this paper, we formulate a chance-constrained
mission-level planning problem for the exploration of PSRs by a solar-powered
rover affected by random faults. The objective is to find a policy that visits
as many waypoints of scientific interest as possible while respecting an upper
bound on the probability of mission failure.
  Our approach assumes that faults occur randomly, but at a known, constant
average rate. Each fault is resolved within a fixed time, simulating the
recovery period of an autonomous system or the time required for a team of
human operators to intervene. Unlike solutions based upon dynamic programming
alone, our method breaks the chance-constrained optimization problem into
smaller offline and online subtasks to make the problem computationally
tractable. Specifically, our solution combines existing mission-level path
planning techniques with a stochastic reachability analysis component. We find
mission plans that remain within reach of safety throughout large state spaces.
To empirically validate our algorithm, we simulate mission scenarios using
orbital terrain and illumination maps of Cabeus Crater. Results from
simulations of multi-day, long-range drives in the LCROSS impact region are
also presented.

\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{L}}ogic (SMTL), a novel
formalism for specifying and verifying properties of complex cyber-physical
systems that exhibit behaviors across multiple temporal and abstraction scales.
SMTL extends existing temporal logics by incorporating a stratification
operator, enabling the association of temporal properties with specific
abstraction levels. This allows for the natural expression of multi-scale
requirements while maintaining formal reasoning about inter-level
relationships. We formalize the syntax and semantics of SMTL, proving that it
strictly subsumes metric temporal logic (MTL) and offers enhanced
expressiveness by capturing properties unattainable in existing logics.
Numerical simulations comparing agents operating under MTL and SMTL
specifications show that SMTL enhances agent coordination and safety, reducing
collision rates without substantial computational overhead or compromising path
efficiency. These findings underscore SMTL's potential as a valuable tool for
designing and verifying complex multi-agent systems operating across diverse
temporal and abstraction scales.

transport mobility in terms of safety, reliability, and decarbonization.
However, ensuring safety and efficiency in interactive during within dynamic
and diverse environments is still a primary barrier to large-scale AV adoption.
In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an advanced
AI-based approach, enabling AVs to learn decision-making strategies adaptively
from data and interactions. DRL strategies are better suited than traditional
rule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving
environments due to their adaptivity. However, varying driving scenarios
present distinct challenges, such as avoiding obstacles on highways and
reaching specific exits at intersections, requiring different scenario-specific
decision-making algorithms. Many DRL algorithms have been proposed in
interactive decision-making. However, a rationale review of these DRL
algorithms across various scenarios is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive
evaluation is essential to assess these algorithms from multiple perspectives,
including those of vehicle users and vehicle manufacturers. This survey reviews
the application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical
scenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios
include highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections.
Furthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale
criteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency,
unselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI). Each criterion of DDTUI is
specifically analyzed in relation to the reviewed algorithms. Finally, the
challenges for future DRL-based decision-making algorithms are summarized.

                                        <span>  When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety
does no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value.
Conventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to
re-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which,
however, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of
managing runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of
the authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing
literature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to
recover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the
system's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to
modify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame
the reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM)
based Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution
derivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method
in terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the
results show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM
based Newton's method) $\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than
the OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our
method over the OCR method is $40.81\%$ without considering the deadline of run
time. The success rate remains at $49.44\%$ for the proposed method, while it
becomes $0\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \; seconds$ is
imposed.

universal rigidity and affine localizability is a critical prerequisite, but it
has not yet been well addressed, especially when additional agents join the
formation or link/agent failures emerge. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the problem of constructing affine formation frameworks in three
scenarios, including vertex addition, edge deletion and vertex deletion. Our
approach starts from the original affine formation and uses geometric methods
to locally adjust the structure of the weighted graph to describe the topology,
so that the modified framework maintains the universal rigidity and affine
localizability. Notably, the developed strategies only utilize local
measurements and exhibit distributed characteristics, laying the foundation for
applications in multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the compatibility with
affine formation control proposals, we present a case study on affine formation
tracking in a multi-UAV formation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
algorithms in constructing eligible frameworks in aforementioned scenarios.
Moreover, a comparative simulations is also conducted to highlight the low time
complexity of our distributed algorithm relative to the centralized
optimization-based method.

disaster areas are challenging for autonomous navigation because of terrain
irregularities. In particular, it is crucial to plan a path to avoid risky
terrain and reach the goal quickly and safely. In this paper, we propose a
method for safe and distance-efficient path planning, leveraging Traversal Risk
Graph (TRG), a novel graph representation that takes into account geometric
traversability of the terrain. TRG nodes represent stability and reachability
of the terrain, while edges represent relative traversal risk-weighted path
candidates. Additionally, TRG is constructed in a wavefront propagation manner
and managed hierarchically, enabling real-time planning even in large-scale
environments. Lastly, we formulate a graph optimization problem on TRG that
leads the robot to navigate by prioritizing both safe and short paths. Our
approach demonstrated superior safety, distance efficiency, and fast processing
time compared to the conventional methods. It was also validated in several
real-world experiments using a quadrupedal robot. Notably, TRG-planner
contributed as the global path planner of an autonomous navigation framework
for the DreamSTEP team, which won the Quadruped Robot Challenge at ICRA 2023.

                                        <span>  Autonomous robotic grasping of uncertain objects in uncertain environments is
an impactful open challenge for the industries of the future. One such industry
is the recycling of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) materials,
in which electric devices are disassembled and readied for the recovery of raw
materials. Since devices may contain hazardous materials and their disassembly
involves heavy manual labor, robotic disassembly is a promising venue. However,
since devices may be damaged, dirty and unidentified, robotic disassembly is
challenging since object models are unavailable or cannot be relied upon. This
case study explores grasping strategies for industrial robotic disassembly of
WEEE devices with uncertain vision data. We propose three grippers and
appropriate tactile strategies for force-based manipulation that improves
grasping robustness. For each proposed gripper, we develop corresponding
strategies that can perform effectively in different grasping tasks and
leverage the grippers design and unique strengths. Through experiments
conducted in lab and factory settings for four different WEEE devices, we
demonstrate how object uncertainty may be overcome by tactile sensing and
compliant techniques, significantly increasing grasping success rates.

stability analysis and control. The proposed model enables the effects of
derivative bounds to be incorporated into system eigenvalue analysis, while
replicating the behavior of conventional non-smooth RLs with high fidelity. In
addition, it can be duly modified to enhance the system's dynamic control
performance. The behavior of the proposed model is demonstrated through

satellite performing relative proximity operations with an observer satellite.
The absolute and relative translation and attitude equations of motion for the
satellite pair are modeled using dual quaternions. The observability of the
relative dual quaternion system is analyzed using empirical observability
Gramian methods. The optimal placement of a fiducial marker set, in which each
marker gives simultaneous optical range and attitude measurements, is
determined for the pair of satellites. A geostationary flyby between the
observing body (chaser) and desired (target) satellites is numerically
simulated and the optimal fiducial placement sets of five and ten on the
surface of the desired satellite are solved. It is shown that the optimal
solution maximizes the distance between fiducial markers and selects marker
locations that are most sensitive to measuring changes in the state during the
nonlinear trajectory, despite being visible for less time than other candidate
marker locations. Definitions and properties of quaternions and dual
quaternions, and parallels between the two, are presented alongside the
relative motion model.

Decarbonization (NUFRIEND) framework is a comprehensive industry-oriented tool
for simulating the deployment of new energy technologies including biofuels,
e-fuels, battery-electric, and hydrogen locomotives. By classifying fuel types
into two categories based on deployment requirements, the associated optimal
charging/fueling facility location and sizing problem are solved with a
five-step framework. Life cycle analyses (LCA) and techno-economic analyses
(TEA) are used to estimate carbon reduction, capital investments, cost of
carbon reduction, and operational impacts, enabling sensitivity analysis with
operational and technological parameters. The framework is illustrated on
lower-carbon drop-in fuels as well as battery-electric technology deployments
for US Eastern and Western Class I railroad networks. Drop-in fuel deployments
are modeled as admixtures with diesel in existing locomotives, while
battery-electric deployments are shown for varying technology penetration
levels and locomotive ranges. When mixed in a 50 percent ratio with diesel,
results show biodiesel's capacity to reduce emissions at 36 percent with a cost
of 0.13 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, while e-fuels offer a 50 percent
emissions reduction potential at a cost of 0.22 USD per kilogram of CO2
reduced. Battery-electric results for 50 percent deployment over all ton-miles
highlight the value of future innovations in battery energy densities as
scenarios assuming 800-mile range locomotives show an estimated emissions
reduction of 46 percent with a cost of 0.06 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced,
compared to 16 percent emissions reduction at a cost of 0.11 USD per kilogram
of CO2 reduced for 400-mile range locomotives.

                                        <span>  This paper studies the bearing-based simultaneous localization and affine
formation tracking (SLAFT) control problem for fixed-wing unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs). In the considered problem, only a small set of UAVs, named
leaders, can obtain their global positions, and the other UAVs only have access
to bearing information relative to their neighbors. To address the problem, we
propose novel schemes by integrating the distributed bearing-based
self-localization algorithm and the observer-based affine formation tracking
controller. The designed localization algorithm estimates the global position
by using inter-UAV bearing measurements, and the observer-based controller
tracks the desired formation with the estimated positions. A key distinction of
our approach is extending the SLAFT control scheme to the bearing-based
coordination of nonholonomic UAV systems, where the desired inter-UAV bearings
can be time-varying, instead of constant ones assumed in most of the existing
results. Two control schemes with different convergence rates are designed to
meet desired task requirements under different conditions. The stability
analysis of the two schemes for SLAFT control is proved, and numerous
simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis.

enhancing health and reducing energy consumption in these settings is a central
research focus. With the advancement of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have
emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the
indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to
employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to

analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive
use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location
recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Furthermore, this review
underscores the vast potential for expanding recommender systems and RL
applications in buildings and indoor environments. Fields ripe for innovation
include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendation, and
optimization of environments tailored for specific needs, such as sleep and
productivity enhancements based on user feedback. The study also notes the
limitations of the method in capturing subtle academic nuances. Future
improvements could involve integrating and fine-tuning pre-trained language

on the Complex Frequency (CF) concept. The controller's objective is to
maintain a constant CF of the voltage at the terminals of the IBR by adjusting
its current reference. This current is imposed based on the well-known power
flow equation, the dynamics of which are calculated through the estimation of
the CF of the voltages of the adjacent buses. Performance is evaluated by
analyzing local variations in frequency and magnitude of the voltage, as well
as the response of the system's Center of Inertia (CoI) frequency, and then
compared with conventional frequency droop, PI voltage controllers and virtual
inertia. The case study utilizes the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus model of
the Irish transmission grid and considers various contingencies and
sensitivities such as the impact of limiters, delays, noise, R/X ratio, and EMT
dynamics. Results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the
conventional controllers, leading to significant improvements in the overall
dynamic response of the system.

differentiability and quadratic bundles of nonsmooth functions that have been
very recently proposed by Rockafellar in the framework of second-order

subdifferentials, are defined in primal spaces. We develop new techniques to
study generalized twice differentiability for a broad class of prox-regular

bundles of prox-regular functions are shown to be nonempty, which provides the
ground of potential applications in variational analysis and optimization.

problems developed in a recent work by the authors [`Compressed sensing for
inverse problems and the sample complexity of the sparse Radon transform', J.
Eur. Math. Soc., to appear], which was originally focused on the sparse Radon
transform. We demonstrate that the underlying abstract framework, based on
infinite-dimensional compressed sensing and generalized sampling techniques,
can effectively handle a variety of practical applications. Specifically, we
analyze three case studies: (1) The reconstruction of a sparse signal from a
finite number of pointwise blurred samples; (2) The recovery of the (sparse)
source term of an elliptic partial differential equation from finite samples of
the solution; and (3) A moderately ill-posed variation of the classical sensing
problem of recovering a wavelet-sparse signal from finite Fourier samples,
motivated by magnetic resonance imaging. For each application, we establish
rigorous recovery guarantees by verifying the key theoretical requirements,
including quasi-diagonalization and coherence bounds. Our analysis reveals that
careful consideration of balancing properties and optimized sampling strategies
can lead to improved reconstruction performance. The results provide a unified
theoretical foundation for compressed sensing approaches to inverse problems
while yielding practical insights for specific applications.

if W is a diagonally dominant positive definite M-matrix. The techniques used
to prove convexity are well-known in linear algebra and essentially involves
factoring the Hessian in a way that is amenable to martix analysis. Using
similar techniques, two classes of convex homogeneous polynomials is derived -
namely, p^TW p2 and (p^k)^TW p^k - the latter also happen to be SOS-convex.
Lastly, usign the same techniques, it is also shown that the function p^TW ep
is convex over the positive reals only if W is a non-negative diagonal matrix.
Discussions regarding the utility of these functions and examples accompany the

                                        <span>  We consider a dynamic pricing problem in network revenue management where
customer behavior is predicted by a choice model, i.e., the multinomial logit
(MNL) model. The problem, even in the static setting (i.e., customer demand
remains unchanged over time), is highly non-concave in prices. Existing studies
mostly rely on the observation that the objective function is concave in terms
of purchasing probabilities, implying that the static pricing problem with
linear constraints on purchasing probabilities can be efficiently solved.
However, this approach is limited in handling constraints on prices, noting
that such constraints could be highly relevant in some real business
considerations. To address this limitation, in this work, we consider a general
pricing problem that involves constraints on both prices and purchasing
probabilities. To tackle the non-concavity challenge, we develop an
approximation mechanism that allows solving the constrained static pricing
problem through bisection and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). We
further extend the approximation method to the dynamic pricing context. Our
approach involves a resource decomposition method to address the curse of
dimensionality of the dynamic problem, as well as a MILP approach to solving
sub-problems to near-optimality. Numerical results based on generated instances
of various sizes indicate the superiority of our approximation approach in both
static and dynamic settings.

                                        <span>  We develop an Integral Transformation Method (ITM) for the study of suitable
optimal control and differential game models. This allows for a solution to
such dynamic problems to be found through solving a family of optimization
problems parametrized by time. The method is quite flexible, and it can be used
in several economic applications where the state equation and the objective
functional are linear in a state variable. We illustrate the ITM in the context
of a two-country integrated assessment climate model. We characterize
emissions, consumption, transfers, and welfare by computing the Nash equilibria
of the associated dynamic game. We then compare them to efficiency benchmarks.
Further, we apply the ITM in a robust control setup, where we investigate how
(deep) uncertainty affects climate outcomes.

                                        <span>  The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for
various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its
popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings
satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the
non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of
such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic
innovation beyond CE.
  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the
general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves
uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under
only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any
fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief,
CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem
instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the
distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete
settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$
regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$
quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional
reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary
setting.
  To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques.
Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong
concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to
improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These
techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making
contexts.

satellite performing relative proximity operations with an observer satellite.
The absolute and relative translation and attitude equations of motion for the
satellite pair are modeled using dual quaternions. The observability of the
relative dual quaternion system is analyzed using empirical observability
Gramian methods. The optimal placement of a fiducial marker set, in which each
marker gives simultaneous optical range and attitude measurements, is
determined for the pair of satellites. A geostationary flyby between the
observing body (chaser) and desired (target) satellites is numerically
simulated and the optimal fiducial placement sets of five and ten on the
surface of the desired satellite are solved. It is shown that the optimal
solution maximizes the distance between fiducial markers and selects marker
locations that are most sensitive to measuring changes in the state during the
nonlinear trajectory, despite being visible for less time than other candidate
marker locations. Definitions and properties of quaternions and dual
quaternions, and parallels between the two, are presented alongside the
relative motion model.

controlled stochastic partial differential equations. More precisely, we
establish the existence of stochastic optimal feedback control for the
controlled stochastic partial differential equations with fully monotone
coefficients by a minimizing sequence for the control problem. Using the
Faedo-Galerkin approximations, the uniform estimates and the tightness in some
appropriate space for the Faedo-Galerkin approximating solution can be obtain
to prove the well-posedness of the controlled stochastic partial differential
equations with fully monotone coefficients. The results obtained in the present
paper may be applied to various types of controlled stochastic partial
differential equations, such as the controlled stochastic convection diffusion
equation.

Decarbonization (NUFRIEND) framework is a comprehensive industry-oriented tool
for simulating the deployment of new energy technologies including biofuels,
e-fuels, battery-electric, and hydrogen locomotives. By classifying fuel types
into two categories based on deployment requirements, the associated optimal
charging/fueling facility location and sizing problem are solved with a
five-step framework. Life cycle analyses (LCA) and techno-economic analyses
(TEA) are used to estimate carbon reduction, capital investments, cost of
carbon reduction, and operational impacts, enabling sensitivity analysis with
operational and technological parameters. The framework is illustrated on
lower-carbon drop-in fuels as well as battery-electric technology deployments
for US Eastern and Western Class I railroad networks. Drop-in fuel deployments
are modeled as admixtures with diesel in existing locomotives, while
battery-electric deployments are shown for varying technology penetration
levels and locomotive ranges. When mixed in a 50 percent ratio with diesel,
results show biodiesel's capacity to reduce emissions at 36 percent with a cost
of 0.13 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, while e-fuels offer a 50 percent
emissions reduction potential at a cost of 0.22 USD per kilogram of CO2
reduced. Battery-electric results for 50 percent deployment over all ton-miles
highlight the value of future innovations in battery energy densities as
scenarios assuming 800-mile range locomotives show an estimated emissions
reduction of 46 percent with a cost of 0.06 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced,
compared to 16 percent emissions reduction at a cost of 0.11 USD per kilogram
of CO2 reduced for 400-mile range locomotives.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we show that the value functions of mean field control
problems with common noise are the unique viscosity solutions to fully
second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, in a Crandall-Lions-like
framework. We allow the second-order derivative in measure to be
state-dependent and thus infinite-dimensional, rather than derived from a
finite-dimensional operator, hence the term ''fully''. Our argument leverages
the construction of smooth approximations from particle systems developed by
Cosso, Gozzi, Kharroubi, Pham, and Rosestolato [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2023],
and the compactness argument via penalization of measure moments in Soner and
Yan [Appl. Math. Optim., 2024]. Our work addresses unbounded dynamics and
state-dependent common noise volatility, and to our knowledge, this is the
first result of its kind in the literature.

                                        <span>  In two-body dynamics, it is proven that for a sufficiently long flight time,
generating infinitely many iso-impulse solutions is possible by solving a
number of $\Delta v$-allocation problems analytically. A distinct feature of
these solutions is the existence of two impulse anchor positions (APs) that
correspond to the locations of the impulses on time-free, phase-free, base
solutions. In this paper, the existence and utility of three-impulse base
solutions are investigated and their complete solution spaces are characterized
and analyzed. Since two- and three-impulse base solutions exist, a question
arises: How many APs should base solutions have? A strategy is developed for
choosing base solutions, which offers a certificate for $\Delta v$ optimality
of general three-dimensional time-fixed rendezvous solutions. Simultaneous
allocation of $\Delta v$ at two and three APs is formulated, which allows for
generating $\Delta v$-optimal solutions while satisfying a constraint on
individual impulses such that $\Delta v \leq \Delta v_\text{max}$. All
iso-impulse solutions are classified in four layers: 1) base solutions, 2)
feasible solution spaces, 3) solution families, and 4) solution envelopes. The
method enables us to characterize the complete solution space of
minimum-$\Delta v$, iso-impulse, three-dimensional trajectories under the
nonlinear two-body dynamics. To illustrate the utility of the method,
interplanetary and geocentric problems are considered.

estimation in nonlinear ordinary differential equations, focusing on the case
where the data is noisy, sparse, irregularly sampled, includes multiple
experiments, and does not directly measure the system state or its
time-derivative. To account for such low-quality data, we propose a new
framework for gradient-based parameter estimation which uses the Picard
operator to reformulate the problem as constrained optimization with
infinite-dimensional variables and constraints. We then use the contractive
properties of the Picard operator to propose a class of gradient-contractive
algorithms and provide conditions under which such algorithms are guaranteed to
converge to a local optima. The algorithms are then tested on a battery of
models and variety of datasets in order to demonstrate robustness and
improvement over alternative approaches.

under weighted bottleneck Hamming distance, denoted as (RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). The
problem aims to minimize the total cost under weighted bottle-neck Hamming
distance such that the length of the shortest root-leaf path of the tree is
lower-bounded by a given value by adjusting the length of some edges.
Additionally, the specified lower bound must correspond to the length of a
particular root-leaf path. Through careful analysis of the problem's structural
properties, we develop an algorithm with $O(n\log n)$ time complexity to solve
(RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). Furthermore, by removing the path-length constraint, we
derive the Minimum Cost Shortest Path Interdiction Problem on Trees (MCSPIT),
for which we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm that operates under
weighted bottleneck Hamming distance. Extensive computational experiments
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of both algorithms.

                                        <span>  The solution of potential-driven steady-state flow in large networks is a
task which manifests in various engineering applications, such as transport of
natural gas or water through pipeline networks. The resultant system of
nonlinear equations depends on the network topology and in general there is no
numerical algorithm that offers guaranteed convergence to the solution
(assuming a solution exists). Some methods offer guarantees in cases where the
network topology satisfies certain assumptions, but these methods fail for
larger networks. On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson algorithm offers a
convergence guarantee if the starting point lies close to the (unknown)
solution. It would be advantageous to compute the solution of the large
nonlinear system through the solution of smaller nonlinear sub-systems wherein
the solution algorithms (Newton-Raphson or otherwise) are more likely to
succeed. This article proposes and describes such a procedure, an hierarchical
network partitioning algorithm that enables the solution of large nonlinear
systems corresponding to potential-driven steady-state network flow equations.

and retirement decisions by minimizing both investment and operation costs. In
order to provide credible support for planning and policy decisions, these
models need to include detailed operations and time-coupling constraints,
consider multiple possible realizations of weather-related parameters and
demand data, and allow modeling of discrete investment and retirement
decisions. Such requirements result in large-scale mixed-integer optimization
problems that are intractable with off-the-shelf solvers. Hence, practical
solution approaches often rely on carefully designed abstraction techniques to
find the best compromise between reduced computational burden and model
accuracy. Benders decomposition offers scalable approaches to leverage
distributed computing resources and enable models with both high resolution and
computational performance. In this study, we implement a tailored Benders
decomposition method for large-scale capacity expansion models with multiple
planning periods, stochastic operational scenarios, time-coupling policy
constraints, and multi-day energy storage and reservoir hydro resources. Using
multiple case studies, we also evaluate several level-set regularization
schemes to accelerate convergence. We find that a regularization scheme that
selects planning decisions in the interior of the feasible set shows superior
performance compared to previously published methods, enabling high-resolution,
mixed-integer planning problems with unprecedented computational performance.

applications (such as boundary control and control of delay equations with
delay in the control) with the ultimate aim of finding solutions of the
associated HJB equations, regular enough to find optimal feedback controls.
These problems are difficult to treat since the underlying transition
semigroups do not possess good smoothing properties nor the so-called
"structure condition" which typically allows to apply the backward equations
approach. In the papers [14], [15], and, more recently, [16] we studied such
problems developing new partial smoothing techniques which allowed us to obtain
the required regularity in the case when the cost functional is independent of
the state variable. This is a somehow strong restriction which is not verified
in most applications. In this paper (which can be considered a continuation of
the research of the above papers) we develop a new approach to overcome this
restriction. We extend the partial smoothing result to a wider class of
functions which depend on the whole trajectory of the underlying semigroup and
we use this as a key tool to improve our regularity result for the HJB
equation. The fact that such class depends on trajectories requires a
nontrivial technical work as we have to lift the original transition semigroup
to a space of trajectories, defining a new "high-level" environment where our
problems can be solved.

                                        <span>  Deciding bank interest rates has been a long-standing challenge in finance.
It is crucial to ensure that the selected rates balance market share and
profitability. However, traditional approaches typically focus on the interest
rate changes of individual banks, often neglecting the interactions with other
banks in the market. This work proposes a novel framework that models the
interest rate problem as a major-minor mean field game within the context of an
interbank game. To incorporate the complex interactions between banks, we
utilize mean-field theory and employ impulsive control to model the overhead in
rate adjustments. Ultimately, we solve this optimal control problem using a new
deep Q-network method, which iterates the parameterized action value functions
for major and minor players and updates the networks in a Fictitious Play way.
Our proposed algorithm converges, offering a solution that enables the analysis
of strategies for major and minor players in the market under the Nash
Equilibrium.

a nonsmooth function inspired by the Goldstein eps-subdifferential. It
comprises the coefficients of all existing second-order Taylor expansions in an
eps-ball around a given point. Based on this concept, we define a model of the
objective as the maximum of these Taylor expansions, and derive a sampling
scheme for its approximation in practice. Minimization of this model induces a
simple descent method, for which we show convergence for the case where the
objective is convex or of max-type. While we do not prove any rate of
convergence of this method, numerical experiments suggest superlinear behavior
with respect to the number of oracle calls of the objective.

                                        <span>  In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at
different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing
the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the
error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a
property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this
decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by
establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA,
offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. To achieve
these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish
tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the
interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative
auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale
update on the slow-time-scale update.

the dynamism and effectiveness of conversations, but only when effectively
managed by all parties involved. Despite advancements in robotic systems,
state-of-the-art systems still have limited capabilities in handling
user-initiated interruptions in real-time. Prior research has primarily focused
on post hoc analysis of interruptions. To address this gap, we present a system
that detects user-initiated interruptions and manages them in real-time based
on the interrupter's intent (i.e., cooperative agreement, cooperative
assistance, cooperative clarification, or disruptive interruption). The system
was designed based on interaction patterns identified from human-human
interaction data. We integrated our system into an LLM-powered social robot and
validated its effectiveness through a timed decision-making task and a
contentious discussion task with 21 participants. Our system successfully
handled 93.69% (n=104/111) of user-initiated interruptions. We discuss our
learnings and their implications for designing interruption-handling behaviors
in conversational robots.

algorithm for multi-robot kinodynamic planning. Our experimental results show
the capability of K-ARC to plan for up to 32 planar mobile robots, while
achieving up to an order of magnitude of speed-up compared to previous methods
in various scenarios. K-ARC is able to achieve this due to its two main
properties. First, K-ARC constructs its solution iteratively by planning in
segments, where initial kinodynamic paths are found through optimization-based
approaches and the inter-robot conflicts are resolved through sampling-based
approaches. The interleaving use of sampling-based and optimization-based
approaches allows K-ARC to leverage the strengths of both approaches in
different sections of the planning process where one is more suited than the
other, while previous methods tend to emphasize on one over the other. Second,
K-ARC builds on a previously proposed multi-robot motion planning framework,
Adaptive Robot Coordination (ARC), and inherits its strength of focusing on
coordination between robots only when needed, saving computation efforts. We
show how the combination of these two properties allows K-ARC to achieve
overall better performance in our simulated experiments with increasing numbers
of robots, increasing degrees of problem difficulties, and increasing
complexities of robot dynamics.

gained importance in various applications including the Internet of Things
(IoT), robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To tackle some of the
challenges associated with indoor tracking, this study explores the potential
benefits of incorporating the SO(3) manifold structure of the rotation matrix.
The goal is to enhance the 3D tracking performance of the extended Kalman
filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) of a moving target within an
indoor environment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed extended Kalman
filter with Riemannian (EKFRie) and unscented Kalman filter with Riemannian
(UKFRie) algorithms consistently outperform the conventional EKF and UKF in
terms of position and orientation accuracy. While the conventional EKF and UKF
achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36m and 0.43m, respectively, for a
long stair path, the proposed EKFRie and UKFRie algorithms achieved a lower
RMSE of 0.21m and 0.10m. Our results show also the outperforming of the
proposed algorithms over the EKF and UKF algorithms with the Isosceles triangle
manifold. While the latter achieved RMSE of 7.26cm and 7.27cm, respectively,
our proposed algorithms achieved RMSE of 6.73cm and 6.16cm. These results
demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed algorithms.

                                        <span>  In social robot navigation, traditional metrics like proxemics and behavior
naturalness emphasize human comfort and adherence to social norms but often
fail to capture an agent's autonomy and adaptability in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces human empowerment, an information-theoretic concept that
measures a human's ability to influence their future states and observe those
changes, as a complementary metric for evaluating social compliance. This
metric reveals how robot navigation policies can indirectly impact human
empowerment. We present a framework that integrates human empowerment into the
evaluation of social performance in navigation tasks. Through numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that human empowerment as a metric not only aligns
with intuitive social behavior, but also shows statistically significant
differences across various robot navigation policies. These results provide a
deeper understanding of how different policies affect social compliance,
highlighting the potential of human empowerment as a complementary metric for
future research in social navigation.

                                        <span>  In this article we propose a game-theoretic approach to the multi-robot task
allocation problem using the framework of global games. Each task is associated
with a global signal, a real-valued number that captures the task execution
progress and/or urgency. We propose a linear objective function for each robot
in the system, which, for each task, increases with global signal and decreases
with the number assigned robots. We provide conditions on the objective
function hyperparameters to induce a mixed Nash equilibrium, i.e., solutions
where all robots are not assigned to a single task. The resulting algorithm
only requires the inversion of a matrix to determine a probability distribution
over the robot assignments. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in
simulation and provide direction for applications and future work.

                                        <span>  People have a variety of preferences for how robots behave. To understand and
reason about these preferences, robots aim to learn a reward function that
describes how aligned robot behaviors are with a user's preferences. Good
representations of a robot's behavior can significantly reduce the time and
effort required for a user to teach the robot their preferences. Specifying
these representations -- what "features" of the robot's behavior matter to
users -- remains a difficult problem; Features learned from raw data lack
semantic meaning and features learned from user data require users to engage in
tedious labeling processes. Our key insight is that users tasked with
customizing a robot are intrinsically motivated to produce labels through
exploratory search; they explore behaviors that they find interesting and
ignore behaviors that are irrelevant. To harness this novel data source of
exploratory actions, we propose contrastive learning from exploratory actions
(CLEA) to learn trajectory features that are aligned with features that users
care about. We learned CLEA features from exploratory actions users performed
in an open-ended signal design activity (N=25) with a Kuri robot, and evaluated
CLEA features through a second user study with a different set of users (N=42).
CLEA features outperformed self-supervised features when eliciting user
preferences over four metrics: completeness, simplicity, minimality, and
explainability.

crucial features in robotics and our daily lives. In recent years, deep
learning has significantly advanced inertial sensing performance and
robustness. Deep-learning techniques are used in different domains and
platforms to enhance network performance, but no common benchmark is available.
The latter is critical for fair comparison and evaluation in a standardized
framework as well as development in the field. To fill this gap, we define and
thoroughly analyze 13 data-driven techniques for improving neural inertial
regression networks. A focus is placed on three aspects of neural networks:
network architecture, data augmentation, and data preprocessing. Extensive
experiments were made across six diverse datasets that were collected from
various platforms including quadrotors, doors, pedestrians, and mobile robots.
In total, over 1079 minutes of inertial data sampled between 120-200Hz were
analyzed. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation through rotation and
noise addition consistently yields the most significant improvements. Moreover,
this study outlines benchmarking strategies for enhancing neural inertial
regression networks.

                                        <span>  For millions of adults with mobility limitations, eating meals is a daily
challenge. A variety of robotic systems have been developed to address this
societal need. Unfortunately, end-user adoption of robot-assisted feeding is
limited, in part because existing devices are unable to seamlessly grasp,
manipulate, and feed diverse foods. Recent works seek to address this issue by
creating new algorithms for food acquisition and bite transfer. In parallel to
these algorithmic developments, however, we hypothesize that mechanical
intelligence will make it fundamentally easier for robot arms to feed humans.
We therefore propose Kiri-Spoon, a soft utensil specifically designed for
robot-assisted feeding. Kiri-Spoon consists of a spoon-shaped kirigami
structure: when actuated, the kirigami sheet deforms into a bowl of increasing
curvature. Robot arms equipped with Kiri-Spoon can leverage the kirigami
structure to wrap-around morsels during acquisition, contain those items as the
robot moves, and then compliantly release the food into the user's mouth.
Overall, Kiri-Spoon combines the familiar and comfortable shape of a standard
spoon with the increased capabilities of soft robotic grippers. In what
follows, we first apply a stakeholder-driven design process to ensure that
Kiri-Spoon meets the needs of caregivers and users with physical disabilities.
We next characterize the dynamics of Kiri-Spoon, and derive a mechanics model
to relate actuation force to the spoon's shape. The paper concludes with three
separate experiments that evaluate (a) the mechanical advantage provided by
Kiri-Spoon, (b) the ways users with disabilities perceive our system, and (c)
how the mechanical intelligence of Kiri-Spoon complements state-of-the-art
algorithms. Our results suggest that Kiri-Spoon advances robot-assisted feeding
across diverse foods, multiple robotic platforms, and different manipulation
algorithms.

                                        <span>  The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has increased the
need for robust and generalizable algorithms for multi-object tracking.
Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion
models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although
computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic
scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address
these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for
vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within
a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition
residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for
manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world
KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.08% HOTA accuracy, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under
different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS.
Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs
while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency. The code will
be publicly available at the time of publishing:

robots faces relevant challenges caused by the limited payload and onboard
computational resources. This paper presents an ultra-wideband localization
system particularly designed for small-scale flapping-wing robots. The solution
relies on custom 5 grams ultra-wideband sensors and provides robust, very
efficient (in terms of both computation and energy consumption), and accurate
(mean error of 0.28 meters) 3D position estimation. We validate our system
using a Flapper Nimble+ flapping-wing robot.

                                        <span>  Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for
enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent
challenges regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency.
Recent advancements have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding
intrinsic symmetries of the systems in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems
exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit. This paper presents a novel
framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent system dynamics
that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems with
insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning
to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group
Equivariant Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for
distributed swarming tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of
symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate the effectiveness of our approach,
showcasing its potential for improved generalization and zero-shot scalability.
Our method achieves significant reductions in collision rates and enhances task
success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying swarm sizes.

                                        <span>  Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction offers comprehensive scene
understanding, enabling advances in embodied robotics and photorealistic
simulation. In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method
that formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention
perspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as
queries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention
map. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys
or overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D
Gaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to
preserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this
query formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs
across frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks
rendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance
segmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation
probabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised
by a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens
dynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows
competitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction
performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user
case as a robot simulator. Our project website is at:

robot navigation system composed of a custom robot controller board and an
indoor positioning system. First, the proposed robot controller board has been
specially designed for emerging IoT-based robot applications and is capable of
driving two 6-Amp motor channels. The controller board also embeds an on-board
micro-controller with WIFI connectivity, enabling robot-to-server
communications for IoT applications. Then, working together with the robot
controller board, the proposed positioning system detects the robot's location
using a down-looking webcam and uses the robot's position on the webcam images
to estimate the real-world position of the robot in the environment. The
positioning system can then send commands via WIFI to the robot in order to
steer it to any arbitrary location in the environment. Our experiments show
that the proposed system reaches a navigation error smaller or equal to 0.125
meters while being more than two orders of magnitude more cost-effective
compared to off-the-shelve motion capture (MOCAP) positioning systems.

perception, particularly in tasks like 3D object detection and HD map
construction. These models provide essential and comprehensive static
environmental information for autonomous driving systems. While camera-LiDAR
fusion methods have shown promising results by integrating data from both
modalities, they often depend on complete sensor inputs. This reliance can lead
to low robustness and potential failures when sensors are corrupted or missing,
raising significant safety concerns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the
Multi-Sensor Corruption Benchmark (MSC-Bench), the first comprehensive
benchmark aimed at evaluating the robustness of multi-sensor autonomous driving
perception models against various sensor corruptions. Our benchmark includes 16
combinations of corruption types that disrupt both camera and LiDAR inputs,
either individually or concurrently. Extensive evaluations of six 3D object
detection models and four HD map construction models reveal substantial
performance degradation under adverse weather conditions and sensor failures,
underscoring critical safety issues. The benchmark toolkit and affiliated code

tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings.
However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for
improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their
efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA
({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation
Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of
models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor,
pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for
collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that
provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike
planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and
replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark
several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular
approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning.
Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging
pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the
neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data
efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based
MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for
evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household
robotics tasks.

the limitation of the standard IoU measure in characterizing safety-related
performance for object detectors in navigating contexts. Concretely, we propose
a weighting mechanism to refine IoU, allowing it to assign a higher score to a
prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego
agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical
evaluation processes to select object detectors with better safety-related
performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss
functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment
with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on
EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean
Average Precision as well.

well-explored problem, navigating on deformable terrain such as tall grass or
bushes remains a challenge. To address it, we introduce an explainable,
physics-aware and end-to-end differentiable model which predicts the outcome of
robot-terrain interaction from camera images, both on rigid and non-rigid
terrain. The proposed MonoForce model consists of a black-box module which
predicts robot-terrain interaction forces from onboard cameras, followed by a
white-box module, which transforms these forces and a control signals into
predicted trajectories, using only the laws of classical mechanics. The
differentiable white-box module allows backpropagating the predicted trajectory
errors into the black-box module, serving as a self-supervised loss that
measures consistency between the predicted forces and ground-truth trajectories
of the robot. Experimental evaluation on a public dataset and our data has
shown that while the prediction capabilities are comparable to state-of-the-art
algorithms on rigid terrain, MonoForce shows superior accuracy on non-rigid
terrain such as tall grass or bushes. To facilitate the reproducibility of our
results, we release both the code and datasets.

                                        <span>  The pursuit of artificial consciousness requires conceptual clarity to
navigate its theoretical and empirical challenges. This paper introduces a
composite, multilevel, and multidimensional model of consciousness as a
heuristic framework to guide research in this field. Consciousness is treated
as a complex phenomenon, with distinct constituents and dimensions that can be
operationalized for study and for evaluating their replication. We argue that
this model provides a balanced approach to artificial consciousness research by
avoiding binary thinking (e.g., conscious vs. non-conscious) and offering a
structured basis for testable hypotheses. To illustrate its utility, we focus
on "awareness" as a case study, demonstrating how specific dimensions of
consciousness can be pragmatically analyzed and targeted for potential
artificial instantiation. By breaking down the conceptual intricacies of
consciousness and aligning them with practical research goals, this paper lays
the groundwork for a robust strategy to advance the scientific and technical
understanding of artificial consciousness.

                                        <span>  Collaborative path planning for robot swarms in complex, unknown environments
without external positioning is a challenging problem. This requires robots to
find safe directions based on real-time environmental observations, and to
efficiently transfer and fuse these observations within the swarm. This study
presents a filtering method based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to address
these two issues. We treat sensors' environmental observations as a digital
sampling process. Then, we design two different types of filters for safe
direction extraction, as well as for the compression and reconstruction of
environmental data. The reconstructed data is mapped to probabilistic domain,
achieving efficient fusion of swarm observations and planning decision. The
computation time is only on the order of microseconds, and the transmission
data in communication systems is in bit-level. The performance of our algorithm
in sensor data processing was validated in real world experiments, and the
effectiveness in swarm path optimization was demonstrated through extensive
simulations.

                                        <span>  An omnidirectional multirotor has the maneuverability of decoupled
translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors'
motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the
omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and
direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent
rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking
performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we
propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account
and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by
integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of
motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced
by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global
exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments,
where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple
aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.

minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel
task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate
teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion
(RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the
kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular
commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an
instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several
tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying
priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along
predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and
guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard
surgical kit.

                                        <span>  We present FORGE, a method for sim-to-real transfer of force-aware
manipulation policies in the presence of significant pose uncertainty. During
simulation-based policy learning, FORGE combines a force threshold mechanism
with a dynamics randomization scheme to enable robust transfer of the learned
policies to the real robot. At deployment, FORGE policies, conditioned on a
maximum allowable force, adaptively perform contact-rich tasks while avoiding
aggressive and unsafe behaviour, regardless of the controller gains.
Additionally, FORGE policies predict task success, enabling efficient
termination and autonomous tuning of the force threshold. We show that FORGE
can be used to learn a variety of robust contact-rich policies, including the
forceful insertion of snap-fit connectors. We further demonstrate the
multistage assembly of a planetary gear system, which requires success across
three assembly tasks: nut threading, insertion, and gear meshing. Project

allocation problem using the framework of global games. Each task is associated
with a global signal, a real-valued number that captures the task execution
progress and/or urgency. We propose a linear objective function for each robot
in the system, which, for each task, increases with global signal and decreases
with the number assigned robots. We provide conditions on the objective
function hyperparameters to induce a mixed Nash equilibrium, i.e., solutions
where all robots are not assigned to a single task. The resulting algorithm
only requires the inversion of a matrix to determine a probability distribution
over the robot assignments. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in
simulation and provide direction for applications and future work.

                                        <span>  Stop-and-go traffic waves are known for reducing the efficiency of
transportation systems by increasing traffic oscillations and energy
consumption. In this study, we develop an approach to synthesize a class of
additive feedback controllers for automated vehicles (AVs) to smooth nonlinear
mixed traffic flow, including both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Unlike
recent explicit AV controllers that rely on strict assumptions such as
time-varying equilibrium traffic speed, our proposed AV controller requires
only local traffic information, such as inter-vehicle spacing and relative
speed, which are readily available through AV onboard sensors. Essentially, it
allows a controlled AV to track a subtler version of the perturbed speed
profile resulting from its preceding vehicle, thereby enabling smoother traffic
flow. Additionally, we provide a method for selecting the optimal control
parameters to achieve traffic-smoothing effects efficiently. These unique
features of the developed AV controller ensure much higher implementability. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations of
two distinct traffic scenarios with varying levels of oscillation. The results
show that AVs using the proposed controller are capable of effectively reducing
traffic oscillations and lowering vehicle fuel consumption by up to 46.78\% and
2.74\%, respectively, for a platoon of 10 vehicles. The traffic-smoothing
effect of the controller is more pronounced at higher penetration rates of AVs.
While the performance of the proposed approach is slightly less superior to
that of the most recent additive AV controller, it offers greater
implementability and provides an efficient method for selecting optimal control
parameters.

environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not
change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more
accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary
MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions
associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain
stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of
PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have
been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of
such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the
requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB
procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards
are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of
the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be
modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for
various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this
analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We
compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other
methods in simulations.

                                        <span>  Soft sensing of hard-to-measure variables is often crucial in industrial
processes. Current practices rely heavily on conventional modeling techniques
that show success in improving accuracy. However, they overlook the non-linear
nature, dynamics characteristics, and non-Euclidean dependencies between
complex process variables. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework
known as a Knowledge discovery graph Attention Network for effective Soft
sensing (KANS). Unlike the existing deep learning soft sensor models, KANS can
discover the intrinsic correlations and irregular relationships between the
multivariate industrial processes without a predefined topology. First, an
unsupervised graph structure learning method is introduced, incorporating the
cosine similarity between different sensor embedding to capture the
correlations between sensors. Next, we present a graph attention-based
representation learning that can compute the multivariate data parallelly to
enhance the model in learning complex sensor nodes and edges. To fully explore
KANS, knowledge discovery analysis has also been conducted to demonstrate the
interpretability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that KANS
significantly outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art methods in
soft sensing performance. Furthermore, the analysis shows that KANS can find
sensors closely related to different process variables without domain
knowledge, significantly improving soft sensing accuracy.

                                        <span>  The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems
presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a
finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a
Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging
when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have
complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel
data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear dynamical systems with additive
stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use
samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition
probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with
intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These
abstractions enable the synthesis of control policies for the concrete
nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the
probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Through numerical
experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in
achieving reliable control under uncertainty.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have
sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a
scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without
lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This
potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However,
the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises
the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs,
as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over
system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through
microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines
(PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following
model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent
collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can
significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity
by 16%, and a 20% HDVs nearly halves it. The study also develops an adaptive
potential (APL) controller that forms APL corridors with modified PLs in the
surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of 23.6% over
the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately
60% CAVs in LFT is required before significant benefits of LFT start appearing
compared to a scenario with all HDVs. These findings open a new research
direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.

                                        <span>  In this study, we have experimentally modelled the movement of a bee colony
in a hive during the winter season and developed a monitoring system that
allows tracking the movement of the bee colony and honey consumption. The
monitoring system consists of four load cells connected to the RP2040
controller based on the Raspberry Pi Pico board, from which data is transmitted
via the MQTT protocol to the Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer via a Wi-Fi network.
The processed data from the Raspberry Pi 5 is recorded in a MySQL database. The
algorithm for finding the location of the bee colony in the hive works
correctly, the trajectory of movement based on the data from the sensors
repeats the physical movement in the experiment, which is an imitation of the
movement of the bee colony in real conditions. The proposed monitoring system
provides continuous observation of the bee colony without adversely affecting
its natural activities and can be integrated with various wireless data
networks. This is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of beekeeping
and maintaining the health of bee colonies.

combining predictive modeling of vehicle flow, adaptive traffic signal control,
and a modular integration architecture through distributed messaging. Using
real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic
fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays
and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms
inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances
energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to
unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings).
Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate
a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include
incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport,
and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges
of urban mobility.

robot navigation system composed of a custom robot controller board and an
indoor positioning system. First, the proposed robot controller board has been
specially designed for emerging IoT-based robot applications and is capable of
driving two 6-Amp motor channels. The controller board also embeds an on-board
micro-controller with WIFI connectivity, enabling robot-to-server
communications for IoT applications. Then, working together with the robot
controller board, the proposed positioning system detects the robot's location
using a down-looking webcam and uses the robot's position on the webcam images
to estimate the real-world position of the robot in the environment. The
positioning system can then send commands via WIFI to the robot in order to
steer it to any arbitrary location in the environment. Our experiments show
that the proposed system reaches a navigation error smaller or equal to 0.125
meters while being more than two orders of magnitude more cost-effective
compared to off-the-shelve motion capture (MOCAP) positioning systems.

significantly in cold climates, requiring a considerable amount of energy to
heat up the EV batteries. This paper proposes a novel technology, namely
temperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power
and reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead
of fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics
and inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of
energy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging
model is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as
battery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV
charging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle
rescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
temperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility
value of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The
proposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost
and a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.

achieving autonomy and optimality for nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamical
systems. However, traditional black-box machine learning methods often lack
formal stability guarantees, which are critical for safety-sensitive aerospace
applications. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework that combines
control Lyapunov functions with supervised learning to provide certifiably
stable, time- and fuel-optimal guidance for rendezvous maneuvers governed by
Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics. The framework is easily extensible to nonlinear
control-affine systems. A novel neural candidate Lyapunov function is developed
to ensure positive definiteness. Subsequently, a control policy is defined, in
which the thrust direction vector minimizes the Lyapunov function's time
derivative, and the thrust throttle is determined using minimal required
throttle. This approach ensures that all loss terms related to the control
Lyapunov function are either naturally satisfied or replaced by the derived
control policy. To jointly supervise the Lyapunov function and the control
policy, a simple loss function is introduced, leveraging optimal state-control
pairs obtained by a polynomial maps based method. Consequently, the trained
neural network not only certifies the Lyapunov function but also generates a
near-optimal guidance policy, even for the bang-bang fuel-optimal problem.
Extensive numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.

with limited resources has led us to develop effective methods for improving
high-performance computing (HPC) applications. In this paper, we introduce LASP
(Lightweight Autotuning of Scientific Application Parameters), a novel strategy
designed to address the parameter search space challenge in edge devices. Our
strategy employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique focused on online
exploration and exploitation. Notably, LASP takes a dynamic approach, adapting
seamlessly to changing environments. We tested LASP with four HPC applications:
Lulesh, Kripke, Clomp, and Hypre. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices. By employing the MAB

                                        <span>  Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are subjected to attacks on both cyber and
physical spaces. In reality, the attackers could launch exponentially unbounded
false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks, which are more destructive and could
lead to the system's collapse or instability. Existing literature generally
addresses bounded attack signals and/or bounded-first-order-derivative attack
signals, which exposes the CPSs to significant threats. In contrast, this paper
proposes a fully-distributed attack-resilient bi-layer defense framework to
address the bipartite output containment problem for heterogeneous multi-agent
systems on signed digraphs, in the presence of EU-FDI attacks on both
cyber-physical layer (CPL) and observer layer (OL). First, we design
attack-resilient dynamic compensators that utilize data communicated on the OL
to estimate the convex combinations of the states and negative states of the
leaders. The attack-resilient compensators address the EU-FDI attacks on the OL
and guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) estimation of the leaders'
states. Then, by using the compensators' states, fully-distributed
attack-resilient controllers are designed on the CPL to further address the
EU-FDI attacks on the actuators. Rigorous mathematical proof based on Lyapunov
stability analysis is provided, establishing the theoretical soundness of the
proposed bi-layer resilient defense framework, by preserving the UUB consensus
and stability against EU-FDI attacks on both CPL and OL. Finally, a comparative
case study for heterogeneous multi-agent systems validate the enhanced
resilience of the proposed defense strategies.

                                        <span>  Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption
needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency
and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound
to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a
large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower
the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by
international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in
power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the
power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which
leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation.
This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy
Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its
carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed
scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system
to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon
footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the
resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power
distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of
the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different
Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware
sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the
local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance
conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while
other regions do not.

failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to
internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events.
Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems
during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while
differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast
conditions. To address this gap in both research and practice, we propose
managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through an
additional reserve service, termed extreme reserve. The procurement of extreme
reserve is co-optimized with energy and regular reserve using a large deviation
theory chance-constrained (LDT-CC) model, where LDT offers a mathematical
framework to quantify the increased uncertainty during extreme events. To
mitigate the high additional costs associated with reserve scheduling under the
LDT-CC model, we also propose an LDT model based on weighted chance constraints
(LDT-WCC). This model prepares the power system for extreme events at a lower
cost, making it a less conservative alternative to the LDT-CC model. The
proposed market design leads to a competitive equilibrium while ensuring cost
recovery. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone
ISO New England system highlight the advantages of the proposed market design.

algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist
in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central
to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders
problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of
evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both
as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via
methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop
first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control
an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on
eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular
physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of
the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link

translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors'
motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the
omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and
direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent
rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking
performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we
propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account
and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by
integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of
motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced
by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global
exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments,
where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple
aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.

                                        <span>  Greenhouse climate control is concerned with maximizing performance in terms
of crop yield and resource efficiency. One promising approach is model
predictive control (MPC), which leverages a model of the system to optimize the
control inputs, while enforcing physical constraints. However, prediction
models for greenhouse systems are inherently inaccurate due to the complexity
of the real system and the uncertainty in predicted weather profiles. For
model-based control approaches such as MPC, this can degrade performance and
lead to constraint violations. Existing approaches address uncertainty in the
prediction model with robust or stochastic MPC methodology; however, these
necessarily reduce crop yield due to conservatism and often bear higher
computational loads. In contrast, learning-based control approaches, such as
reinforcement learning (RL), can handle uncertainty naturally by leveraging
data to improve performance. This work proposes an MPC-based RL control
framework to optimize the climate control performance in the presence of
prediction uncertainty. The approach employs a parametrized MPC scheme that
learns directly from data, in an online fashion, the parametrization of the
constraints, prediction model, and optimization cost that minimizes constraint
violations and maximizes climate control performance. Simulations show that the
approach can learn an MPC controller that significantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in terms of constraint violations and efficient crop growth.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the challenge of teleoperating continuum instruments for
minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel
task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate
teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion
(RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the
kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular
commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an
instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several
tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying
priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along
predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and
guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard
surgical kit.

                                        <span>  This paper studies the observability inequalities for the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation associated with an anharmonic oscillator $H=-\frac{\d^2}{\d x^2}+|x|$.
We build up the observability inequality over an arbitrarily short time
interval $(0,T)$, with an explicit expression for the observation constant
$C_{obs}$ in terms of $T$, for some observable set that has a different
geometric structure compared to those discussed in \cite{HWW}. We obtain the
sufficient conditions and the necessary conditions for observable sets,
respectively. We also present counterexamples to demonstrate that half-lines
are not observable sets, highlighting a major difference in the geometric
properties of observable sets compared to those of Schr\"{o}dinger operators
$H=-\frac{\d^2}{\d x^2}+|x|^{2m}$ with $m\ge 1$.
  Our approach is based on the following ingredients: First, the use of an
Ingham-type spectral inequality constructed in this paper; second, the
adaptation of a quantitative unique compactness argument, inspired by the work
of Bourgain-Burq-Zworski \cite{Bour13}; third, the application of the
Szeg\"{o}'s limit theorem from the theory of Toeplitz matrices, which provides
a new mathematical tool for proving counterexamples of observability
inequalities.

                                        <span>  This paper is devoted to the variational inequality problems. We consider two
classes of problems, the first is classical constrained variational inequality
and the second is the same problem with functional (inequality type)
constraints. To solve these problems, we propose mirror descent-type methods
with a weighting scheme for the generated points in each iteration of the
algorithms. This scheme assigns smaller weights to the initial points and
larger weights to the most recent points, thus it improves the convergence rate
of the proposed methods. For the variational inequality problem with functional
constraints, the proposed method switches between adaptive and non-adaptive
steps in the dependence on the values of the functional constraints at
iterations. We analyze the proposed methods for the time-varying step sizes and
prove the optimal convergence rate for variational inequality problems with
bounded and monotone operators. The results of numerical experiments of the
proposed methods for classical constrained variational inequality problems show
a significant improvement over the modified projection method.

                                        <span>  Machine learning techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness in
achieving autonomy and optimality for nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamical
systems. However, traditional black-box machine learning methods often lack
formal stability guarantees, which are critical for safety-sensitive aerospace
applications. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework that combines
control Lyapunov functions with supervised learning to provide certifiably
stable, time- and fuel-optimal guidance for rendezvous maneuvers governed by
Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics. The framework is easily extensible to nonlinear
control-affine systems. A novel neural candidate Lyapunov function is developed
to ensure positive definiteness. Subsequently, a control policy is defined, in
which the thrust direction vector minimizes the Lyapunov function's time
derivative, and the thrust throttle is determined using minimal required
throttle. This approach ensures that all loss terms related to the control
Lyapunov function are either naturally satisfied or replaced by the derived
control policy. To jointly supervise the Lyapunov function and the control
policy, a simple loss function is introduced, leveraging optimal state-control
pairs obtained by a polynomial maps based method. Consequently, the trained
neural network not only certifies the Lyapunov function but also generates a
near-optimal guidance policy, even for the bang-bang fuel-optimal problem.
Extensive numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.

bi-parameterized recourse (BTSPs), where the first-stage decisions affect both
the objective function and the feasible region of the second-stage problem. To
solve these programs efficiently, we introduce Lagrangian-integrated L-shaped
($L^2$) methods, which guarantee exact solutions when the first-stage decisions
are pure binary. For mixed-binary first-stage programs, we present a
regularization-augmented variant of this method. We also introduce
distributionally robust bi-parameterized two-stage stochastic integer programs
and present an extension of the $L^2$ method and a reformulation-based method
for programs with finite and continuous supports, respectively. Our
computational results show that the $L^2$ method surpasses the benchmark method
for bi-parameterized stochastic network interdiction problems, solving all
instances in 23 seconds on average, whereas the benchmark method failed to
solve any instance within 3600 seconds. Additionally, it achieves optimal
solutions up to 18.4 and 1.7 times faster for instances of risk-neutral and
distributionally robust bi-parameterized stochastic facility location problems,
respectively. Furthermore, BTSPs have applications in solving stochastic
problems with decision-dependent probability distributions or sets of
distributions (ambiguity set). The $L^2$ method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving optimal solutions 5.3 times faster for distributionally
robust facility location problem with a decision-dependent and non-relatively
complete ambiguity set.

such use is a critical challenge. Various techniques have been proposed to
address privacy concerns in data sharing and publishing. However, these methods
often degrade data utility, impacting the performance of machine learning (ML)
models. Our research identifies key limitations in existing optimization models
for privacy preservation, particularly in handling categorical variables,
assessing data utility, and evaluating effectiveness across diverse datasets.
We propose a novel multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously
minimizes information loss and maximizes protection against attacks. This model
is empirically validated using diverse datasets and compared with two existing
algorithms. We assess information loss, the number of individuals subject to
linkage or homogeneity attacks, and ML performance after anonymization. The
results indicate that our model achieves lower information loss and more
effectively mitigates the risk of attacks, reducing the number of individuals
susceptible to these attacks compared to alternative algorithms in some cases.
Additionally, our model maintains comparative ML performance relative to the
original data or data anonymized by other methods. Our findings highlight
significant improvements in privacy protection and ML model performance,
offering a comprehensive framework for balancing privacy and utility in data
sharing.

cardinality of the largest subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. This value
is called the stability number of the graph, and its computation is an NP-hard
problem. In this paper, we solve the stable set problem using the D-wave
quantum annealer. By formulating the problem as a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization problem with the penalty method, we show its optimal value
equals the graph's stability number for specific penalty values. However,
D-Wave's quantum annealer is a heuristic, so the solutions may be far from the
optimum and may not represent stable sets. To address these, we introduce a
post-processing procedure that identifies samples that could lead to improved
solutions. Additionally, we propose a partitioning method to handle larger
instances that cannot be embedded on D-Wave's quantum processing unit. Finally,
we investigate how different penalty parameter values affect the solutions'
quality. Extensive computational results show that the post-processing
procedure significantly improves the solution quality, while the partitioning
method successfully extends our approach to medium-size instances.

                                        <span>  Recent studies and industry advancements indicate that modular vehicles (MVs)
have the potential to enhance transportation systems through their ability to
dock and split during a trip. Although various applications of MVs have been
explored across different domains, their application in logistics remains
underexplored. This study examines the use of MVs in cargo delivery to reduce
total delivery costs. We model the delivery problem for MVs as a variant of the
Vehicle Routing Problem, referred to as the Modular Vehicle Routing Problem
(MVRP). In the MVRP, MVs can either serve customers independently or dock with
other MVs to form a platoon, thereby reducing the average cost per unit. In
this study, we mainly focus on two fundamental types of MVRPs, namely the
capacitated MVRP and the MVRP with time windows. To address these problems, we
first developed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models, which can be
solved using commercial optimization solvers. Given the NP-hardness of this
problem, we also designed a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm with a solution
representation based on Gantt charts and a neighborhood structure tailored for
the MVRP. Multi-start and shaking strategies were incorporated into the TS
algorithm to escape local optima. Additionally, we explored other potential
applications in logistics and discussed problem settings for three MVRP
variants. Results from numerical experiments indicate that the proposed
algorithm successfully identifies nearly all optimal solutions found by the
MILP model in small-size benchmark instances, while also demonstrating good
convergence speed in large-size benchmark instances. Comparative experiments
show that the MVRP approach can reduce costs by approximately 5.6\% compared to
traditional delivery methods. Sensitivity analyses reveal that improving the
cost-saving capability of MV platooning can enhance overall benefits.

                                        <span>  Our first result is a statement of a somewhat general form of a
non-substitution theorem for linear programming problems, along with a very
easy proof of the same. Subsequently, we provide an easy proof of theorem 1 in
a 1979 paper of Olvi L. Mangasarian, based on a new result in terms of two
statements that are each equivalent to a given solution of a linear programming
problem being its unique solution. We also provide a simple proof of the result
that states that the set of optimal solutions of a bounded linear optimization
problem is the set of all convex combinations of its basic optimal solutions
and the set of basic optimal solutions are the extreme points of the set of
optimal solutions. We do so by appealing to the lemma due to Farkas and the
well-known result that states that if a linear optimization problem has an
optimal solution, it has at least one basic optimal solution. Both results we
appeal to have easy proofs. We do not appeal to any version of the Klein-Milman
Theorem or any result in advanced polyhedral combinatorics to obtain our
results. As an application of this result, we obtain a simple proof of the
Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem.

and investment issue pertaining to an insurer that aims to maximize the
expected utility while being subject to random risk aversion. The insurer's
surplus process is modeled approximately by a drifted Brownian motion, and the
financial market is comprised of a risk-free asset and a risky asset with its
price depicted by Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. Within a game
theory framework, a strict verification theorem is formulated to delineate the
equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies as well as the corresponding
value function. Furthermore, through solving the pseudo Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) system, semi-analytical formulations for the equilibrium reinsurance and
investment strategies and the associated value function are obtained under the
exponential utility. Additionally, several numerical experiments are carried
out to demonstrate the characteristics of the equilibrium reinsurance and
investment strategies.

optimal control problem with additive noise and integral state constraint are
derived based on time-implicit and finite element discretization. The
continuous and discrete first-order optimality conditions are deduced by
constructing the Lagrange functional, which contains forward-backward
stochastic parabolic equations and a variational equation. The fully discrete
version of forward-backward stochastic parabolic equations is introduced as an
auxiliary problem and the optimal strong convergence orders are estimated,
which further allows the optimal a priori error estimates for control, state,
adjoint state and multiplier to be derived. Then, a simple and yet efficient
gradient projection algorithm is proposed to solve stochastic parabolic control
problem and its convergence rate is proved. Numerical experiments are carried
out to illustrate the theoretical findings.

                                        <span>  Recently, J. Bochi and P. Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of
matrices $\{A,B\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors)
spectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify
a class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum
maximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the
existence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to
Bochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of
the form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The
efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of
a set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{A,B\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of
the form $BAA$ and $BBA$.

                                        <span>  This work considers the effect of averaging, and more generally
extrapolation, of the iterates of gradient descent in smooth convex
optimization. After running the method, rather than reporting the final
iterate, one can report either a convex combination of the iterates (averaging)
or a generic combination of the iterates (extrapolation). For several common
stepsize sequences, including recently developed accelerated periodically long
stepsize schemes, we show averaging cannot improve gradient descent's
worst-case performance and is, in fact, strictly worse than simply returning
the last iterate. In contrast, we prove a conceptually simple and
computationally cheap extrapolation scheme strictly improves the worst-case
convergence rate: when initialized at the origin, reporting
$(1+1/\sqrt{16N\log(N)})x_N$ rather than $x_N$ improves the best possible
worst-case performance by the same amount as conducting $O(\sqrt{N/\log(N)})$
more gradient steps. Our analysis and characterizations of the best-possible
convergence guarantees are computer-aided, using performance estimation
problems. Numerically, we find similar (small) benefits from such simple
extrapolation for a range of gradient methods.

an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG),
generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered
descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample
efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by
employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was
previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem,
improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless
convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active
constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based
Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem
initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this
reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered
descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due
to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization
scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory
initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our
contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn
the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx)
formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to
reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories
are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx
enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by
a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.

                                        <span>  Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the
trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of
trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key
shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation
is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original
trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the
parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional
diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem
variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered
descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that
can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization
problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that
represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows
for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design
specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional
diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection
and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial
guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and
computationally efficient trajectory generation.

                                        <span>  Forecasting vehicle behavior within complex traffic environments is pivotal
within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Though this technology plays a
significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in
logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle
trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study
introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle
Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning
System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically
predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal
trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after
which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs).
The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the
sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure
maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise
vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred
method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average
Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu
datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred
boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to
establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of
targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction
accuracy.

service robots in an aging society. Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly
due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the
challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that
combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI
system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to
gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are
estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM)
with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes,
robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints
are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is
evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a
Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better
performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research
community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.

like humans. In the service robotics domain, lots of uncertainties result from
exogenous actions and inaccurate localisation of objects and the robot itself.
This makes the robot task scheduling problem challenging. In this article, we
propose a benchmarking framework for systematically assessing the performance
of algorithms scheduling robot tasks. The robot environment incorporates a map
of the room, furniture, transportable objects, and moving humans. The framework
defines interfaces for the algorithms, tasks to be executed, and evaluation
methods. The system consists of several tools, easing testing scenario
generation for training AI-based scheduling algorithms and statistical testing.
For benchmarking purposes, a set of scenarios is chosen, and the performance of
several scheduling algorithms is assessed. The system source is published to
serve the community for tuning and comparable assessment of robot task
scheduling algorithms for service robots. The framework is validated by
assessment of scheduling algorithms for the mobile robot executing patrol,
human fall assistance and simplified pick and place tasks.

This process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. This
article introduces the SysML-based Simulated-Physical Systems Modelling
Language (SPSysML). It is a Domain-Specification Language for evaluating
component reusability in Cyber-Physical Systems incorporating Digital Twins and
other simulated parts. The proposed factors assess the design quantitatively.
SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated
and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML-based systems incorporate DTs
that perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. SPSysML validation is
survey- and application-based. First, we develop a robotic system for an
assisted living project. We propose an SPSysML application procedure called
SPSysAP that manages the considered system development by evaluating the system
designs with the proposed quantitative factors. As a result of the SPSysML
application, we observed an integrity improvement between the simulated and
physical parts of the system. Thus, more system components are shared between
the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical
robot and two simulators based on ROS and ROS2. Additionally, we share a
questionnaire for SPSysML assessment. The feedback that we already received is
published in this article.

robots with various motion skills given visual observation. However, current
visuomotor policies fail to adapt to drastic changes in their visual
observations. We present Perception Stitching that enables strong zero-shot
adaptation to large visual changes by directly stitching novel combinations of
visual encoders. Our key idea is to enforce modularity of visual encoders by
aligning the latent visual features among different visuomotor policies. Our
method disentangles the perceptual knowledge with the downstream motion skills
and allows the reuse of the visual encoders by directly stitching them to a
policy network trained with partially different visual conditions. We evaluate
our method in various simulated and real-world manipulation tasks. While
baseline methods failed at all attempts, our method could achieve zero-shot
success in real-world visuomotor tasks. Our quantitative and qualitative
analysis of the learned features of the policy network provides more insights
into the high performance of our proposed method.

                                        <span>  Compact UAV systems, while advancing delivery and surveillance, pose
significant security challenges due to their small size, which hinders
detection by traditional methods. This paper presents a cost-effective,
unsupervised UAV detection method using spatial-temporal sequence processing to
fuse multiple LiDAR scans for accurate UAV tracking in real-world scenarios.
Our approach segments point clouds into foreground and background, analyzes
spatial-temporal data, and employs a scoring mechanism to enhance detection
accuracy. Tested on a public dataset, our solution placed 4th in the CVPR 2024
UG2+ Challenge, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We plan to
open-source all designs, code, and sample data for the research community

                                        <span>  As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there
is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy,
highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation
solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes
audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a
self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into
mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial
temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are
estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based
estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception
Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based
system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network,
which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently
predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data
or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we
apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our
method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new
benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques
without reliance on ground truth annotations.

devices, such as 2D devices, is helpful to control the robots anytime and
anywhere as intended. Hand-drawn sketches are one of the intuitive ways to
control robots with 2D devices. However, since similar sketches have different
intentions from scene to scene, existing work needs additional modalities to
set the sketches' semantics. This requires complex operations for users and
leads to decreasing usability. In this paper, we propose Sketch-MoMa, a
teleoperation system using the user-given hand-drawn sketches as instructions
to control a robot. We use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the
user-given sketches superimposed on an observation image and infer drawn shapes
and low-level tasks of the robot. We utilize the sketches and the generated
shapes for recognition and motion planning of the generated low-level tasks for
precise and intuitive operations. We validate our approach using
state-of-the-art VLMs with 7 tasks and 5 sketch shapes. We also demonstrate
that our approach effectively specifies the detailed motions, such as how to
grasp and how much to rotate. Moreover, we show the competitive usability of
our approach compared with the existing 2D interface through a user experiment
with 14 participants.

                                        <span>  We study the Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP), introduced by Arkin et al. (SODA'02),
where the objective is to activate a group of n robots, starting from a single
initially active robot. Robots are positioned in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and once
activated, they move at a constant speed to wake up others. The goal is to
minimize the time required to activate the last robot, known as the makespan.
We establish new upper bounds for the makespan under the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms
in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we improve the previous
upper bound for $(\mathbb{R}^2, l_2)$ from $7.07r$ (Bonichon et al., DISC'24)
to $5.064r$. For $(\mathbb{R}^3, l_1)$, we derive a makespan bound of $13r$,
which translates to $22.52r$ for $(\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$. Here, $r$ denotes the
maximum distance of any robot from the initially active robot under the given
norm. To our knowledge, these are the first makespan bounds for FTP in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. Additionally, we show that the maximum makespan for $n$ robots
is not necessarily achieved when robots are equally distributed along the
boundary in $(\mathbb{R}^2, l_2)$. We further investigate FTP in
$(\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$ for specific configurations where robots lie on a
boundary, providing insights into practical scenarios.

but suffers from the sparsity and noisiness of radar sensing, including speckle
noise and multipath effects. This study provides a performance-enhanced radar
SLAM system by incorporating point uncertainty. The basic system is a
radar-inertial odometry system that leverages velocity-aided radar points and
high-frequency inertial measurements. We first propose to model the uncertainty
of radar points in polar coordinates by considering the nature of radar
sensing. Then, the proposed uncertainty model is integrated into the data
association module and incorporated for back-end state estimation. Real-world
experiments on both public and self-collected datasets validate the
effectiveness of the proposed models and approaches. The findings highlight the
potential of incorporating point uncertainty to improve the radar SLAM system.

                                        <span>  False data injection (FDI) attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous
multi-agent systems (MASs). While resilient control strategies address FDI
attacks, they typically have strict assumptions on the attack signals and
overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical
applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a
safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated
operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and
mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and studying
the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under
exponentially unbounded FDI (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel
attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI
attacks on the OL. Then, by solving an optimization problem using the quadratic
programming (QP), the safety constraints for collision avoidance are further
integrated into the SAAR controller design to prevent collisions among
followers. An attack-resilient compensational signal is finally designed to
mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer
(CIL). Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR
controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study
also pioneers a three-dimensional simulation of the SAAR containment control
problem for autonomous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic
multi-agent scenarios.

                                        <span>  This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx),
an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG),
generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered
descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample
efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by
employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was
previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem,
improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless
convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active
constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based
Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem
initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this
reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered
descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due
to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization
scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory
initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our
contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn
the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx)
formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to
reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories
are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx
enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by
a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.

                                        <span>  Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the
trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of
trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key
shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation
is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original
trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the
parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional
diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem
variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered
descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that
can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization
problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that
represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows
for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design
specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional
diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection
and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial
guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and
computationally efficient trajectory generation.

Injection (FDI) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks simultaneously. This letter
introduces a distributed data-driven attack-resilient consensus problem under
both FDI and DoS attacks and proposes a data-driven consensus control
framework, consisting of a group of comprehensive attack-resilient observers.
The proposed group of observers is designed to estimate FDI attacks, external
disturbances, and lumped disturbances, combined with a DoS attack compensation
mechanism. A rigorous stability analysis of the approach is provided to ensure
the boundedness of the distributed neighborhood estimation consensus error. The
effectiveness of the approach is validated through numerical examples involving
both leaderless consensus and leader-follower consensus, demonstrating
significantly improved resilient performance compared to existing data-driven
control approaches.

critical electronic components found onboard that regulate, navigate, and
control UAV travel while ensuring public safety. Contemporary UAV avionics work
together to facilitate success of UAV missions by enabling stable
communication, secure identification protocols, novel energy solutions,
multi-sensor accurate perception and autonomous navigation, precise path
planning, that guarantees collision avoidance, reliable trajectory control, and
efficient data transfer within the UAV system. Moreover, special consideration
must be given to electronic warfare threats prevention, detection, and
mitigation, and the regulatory framework associated with UAV operations. This
review presents the role and taxonomy of each UAV avionics system while
covering shortcomings and benefits of available alternatives within each
system. UAV communication systems, antennas, and location communication
tracking are surveyed. Identification systems that respond to air-to-air or
air-to-ground interrogating signals are presented. UAV classical and more
innovative power sources are discussed. The rapid development of perception
systems improves UAV autonomous navigation and control capabilities. The paper
reviews common perception systems, navigation techniques, path planning
approaches, obstacle avoidance methods, and tracking control. Modern electronic
warfare uses advanced techniques and has to be counteracted by equally advanced
methods to keep the public safe. Consequently, this work presents a detailed
overview of common electronic warfare threats and state-of-the-art
countermeasures and defensive aids. UAV safety occurrences are analyzed in the
context of national regulatory framework and the certification process. Databus
communication and standards for UAVs are reviewed as they enable efficient and
fast real-time data transfer.

reference commands during transition flight. While sparsity between hover and
cruise flight modes can be promoted for effective transitions by formulating
$\ell_{1}$-norm minimization problems, solving these problems offline pointwise
in time can lead to non-smooth reference commands, resulting in abrupt
transitions. This study addresses this limitation by proposing a time-varying
optimization method that explicitly considers time dependence. By leveraging a
prediction-correction interior-point time-varying optimization framework, the
proposed method solves an ordinary differential equation to update reference
commands continuously over time, enabling smooth reference command generation
in real time. Numerical simulations with a two-dimensional Lift+Cruise vehicle
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to
generate smooth reference commands online.

variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we
introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept
of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for
linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and
density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL
commands-more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing regular
ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov
function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long
as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in
fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring
the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and
self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as
R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee
Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^2$ norm. With
comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier
designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel
consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative
to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by
the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.

SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated
and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML-based systems incorporate DTs
that perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. SPSysML validation is
survey- and application-based. First, we develop a robotic system for an
assisted living project. We propose an SPSysML application procedure called
SPSysAP that manages the considered system development by evaluating the system
designs with the proposed quantitative factors. As a result of the SPSysML
application, we observed an integrity improvement between the simulated and
physical parts of the system. Thus, more system components are shared between
the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical
robot and two simulators based on ROS and ROS2. Additionally, we share a
questionnaire for SPSysML assessment. The feedback that we already received is
published in this article.

                                        <span>  In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a
surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian
process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization
problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent
receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is
encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the
objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average
regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of
the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is
applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is
constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our
bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the
communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with
numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating
the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.

optimal control problems in an infinite horizon with conditional mean-field
term in a switching regime environment. The orthogonal decomposition introduced
in [21] has been adopted. Desired algebraic Riccati equations (AREs, for short)
and a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs, for short)

from the solvability of ARE and BSDE. Moreover, the solvability of BSDEs leads
to a characterization of open-loop solvability of the optimal control problem.

three-spacecraft constellation as close to an equilateral triangle with a

using various simplified models to make it easy to approximately solve the

an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG),
generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered
descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample
efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by
employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was
previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem,
improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless
convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active
constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based
Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem
initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this
reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered
descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due
to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization
scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory
initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our
contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn
the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx)
formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to
reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories
are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx
enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by
a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.

optimization problem of finding a convex subset $\omega\subset \Omega$, of a
given measure, minimizing the $p$-distance functional $$\mathcal{J}_p(\omega)
:= \left(\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} |h_\Omega-h_\omega|^p
d\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}},$$ where $1 \le p <\infty$ and
$h_\omega$ and $h_\Omega$ are the support functions of $\omega$ and the fixed
container $\Omega$, respectively.
  We prove the existence of solutions and show that this minimization problem
$\Gamma$-converges, when $p$ tends to $+\infty$, towards the problem of finding
a convex subset $\omega\subset \Omega$, of a given measure, minimizing the
Hausdorff distance to the convex $\Omega$.
  In the planar case, we show that the free parts of the boundary of the
optimal shapes, i.e., those that are in the interior of $\Omega$, are given by
polygonal lines.
  Still in the $2-d$ setting, from a computational perspective, the classical
method based on optimizing Fourier coefficients of support functions is not
efficient, as it is unable to efficiently capture the presence of segments on
the boundary of optimal shapes. We subsequently propose a method combining
Fourier analysis and a recent numerical scheme, allowing to obtain accurate
results, as demonstrated through numerical experiments.

                                        <span>  Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the
trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of
trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key
shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation
is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original
trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the
parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional
diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem
variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered
descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that
can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization
problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that
represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows
for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design
specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional
diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection
and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial
guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and
computationally efficient trajectory generation.

                                        <span>  This paper investigates the application of piecewise linear approximation for
the control of nonlinear systems, particularly focusing on the effective
linearization of systems modeled by the differential equation y^(n) +
f(y,y',...,y^(n-1)) = u(t). We explore the use of PID controllers in
conjunction with piecewise linearization, tackling the challenges of nonlinear
dynamics by dividing the function f into smaller regions or simplices over a
predefined compact set D subset of R^n. The parameter h determines the number
of linear pieces and influences the approximation accuracy. By increasing h,
the system's behavior increasingly mirrors that of the original nonlinear
system, leading to enhanced performance of the control system. The paper
further discusses the optimization of PID controller parameters through the
Particle Swarm Optimization method, with a focus on minimizing the ITAE and ISO
criteria. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach,
highlighting the trade-off between computational complexity and approximation
accuracy in the context of control system design.

to challenges in the timely accessibility of medical devices. Therefore,
effective deployment of automated external defibrillators (AED) can
significantly increase survival rates. Precise and interpretable predictions of
OHCA occurrences provide a solid foundation for efficient and robust AED
deployment optimization. This study develops a novel learn-then-optimize
approach, integrating three key components: a machine learning prediction
model, SHAP-based interpretable analytics, and a SHAP-guided integer
programming (SIP) model. The machine learning model is trained utilizing only
geographic data as inputs to overcome data availability obstacles, and its
strong predictive performance validates the feasibility of interpretation.
Furthermore, the SHAP model elaborates on the contribution of each geographic
feature to the OHCA occurrences. Finally, an integer programming model is
formulated for optimizing AED deployment, incorporating SHAP-weighted OHCA
densities. Various numerical experiments are conducted across different
settings. Based on comparative and sensitive analysis, the optimization effect
of our approach is verified and valuable insights are derived to provide
substantial support for theoretical extension and practical implementation.

                                        <span>  The restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method (rPDHG) is a first-order
method that has recently received significant attention for its computational
effectiveness in solving linear program (LP) problems. Despite its impressive
practical performance, the theoretical iteration bounds for rPDHG can be
exponentially poor. To shrink this gap between theory and practice, we show
that rPDHG achieves polynomial-time complexity in a high-probability sense,
under assumptions on the probability distribution from which the data instance
is generated. We consider not only Gaussian distribution models but also
sub-Gaussian distribution models as well. For standard-form LP instances with
$m$ linear constraints and $n$ decision variables, we prove that rPDHG iterates
settle on the optimal basis in
$\widetilde{O}\left(\tfrac{n^{2.5}m^{0.5}}{\delta}\right)$ iterations, followed
by
$O\left(\frac{n^{0.5}m^{0.5}}{\delta}\ln\big(\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\big)\right)$
iterations to compute an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. These bounds hold with
probability at least $1-\delta$ for $\delta$ that is not exponentially small.
The first-stage bound further improves to
$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{2.5}}{\delta}\right)$ in the Gaussian distribution
model. Experimental results confirm the tail behavior and the polynomial-time
dependence on problem dimensions of the iteration counts. As an application of
our probabilistic analysis, we explore how the disparity among the components
of the optimal solution bears on the performance of rPDHG, and we provide
guidelines for generating challenging LP test instance.

                                        <span>  Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is widely applied in machine learning
and pattern recognition. However, most of the existing methods only consider a
single sparsity, which makes it difficult to select valuable and discriminative
feature subsets from the original high-dimensional feature set. In this paper,
we propose a new UFS method called DSCOFS via embedding double sparsity
constrained optimization into the classical principal component analysis (PCA)
framework. Double sparsity refers to using $\ell_{2,0}$-norm and $\ell_0$-norm
to simultaneously constrain variables, by adding the sparsity of different
types, to achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of identifying
differential features. The core is that $\ell_{2,0}$-norm can remove irrelevant
and redundant features, while $\ell_0$-norm can filter out irregular noisy
features, thereby complementing $\ell_{2,0}$-norm to improve discrimination. An
effective proximal alternating minimization method is proposed to solve the
resulting nonconvex nonsmooth model. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that
the sequence generated by our method globally converges to a stationary point.
Numerical experiments on three synthetic datasets and eight real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and convergence of the proposed
method. In particular, the average clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized
mutual information (NMI) are improved by at least 3.34% and 3.02%,
respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, two
common statistical tests and a new feature similarity metric verify the
advantages of double sparsity. All results suggest that our proposed DSCOFS
provides a new perspective for feature selection.

perfectly indicative of the future, e.g., due to the presence of unobserved
confounders which one cannot "correct" for? Motivated by this question, we
study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are
generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a
heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown
future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will
be evaluated. This work aims at analyzing the performance of central
data-driven policies but also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous
environments and understanding key drivers of performance. We establish a first
result which allows to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad
class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric,
we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by Sample Average
Approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This
analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity
we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the
problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate
through several widely-studied problems -- e.g., newsvendor, pricing -- how
this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies
considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and
heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of
alternative policies to achieve rate-optimality. We derive problem-dependent
policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described
above and provide initial results towards a principled approach for the design
and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.

                                        <span>  A common strategy for solving an unconstrained two-player Nash equilibrium
problem with continuous variables is applying Newton's method to the system of
nonlinear equations obtained by the corresponding first-order necessary
optimality conditions. However, when taking into account the game dynamics, it
is not clear what is the goal of each player when considering that they are
taking their current decision following Newton's iterates. In this paper we
provide an interpretation for Newton's iterate in view of the game dynamics as
follows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of their objective
function parameterized by the other player current decision (as a typical
Jacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach
but with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other
player action, considering that they are following the same Newtonian strategy.
This interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a
backtracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed
Newtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for their
corresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global
convergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or
saddle points, differently from the standard Newton method, which does not
consider the minimization structure of the problem in the non-convex case.
Thus, our method is more robust in comparison with other Jacobi-type strategies
or the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our illustrative
numerical experiments. We also present a proof of the well-definiteness of the
algorithm under some standard assumptions, together with a thorough analysis of
its convergence properties taking into account the game dynamics.

                                        <span>  The robustness of fault detection algorithms against uncertainty is crucial
in the real-world industrial environment. Recently, a new probabilistic design
scheme called distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) has emerged and
received immense interest. Despite its robustness against unknown distributions
in practice, current DRFD focuses on the overall detectability of all possible
faults rather than the detectability of critical faults that are a priori
known. Henceforth, a new DRFD trade-off design scheme is put forward in this
work by utilizing prior fault information. The key contribution includes a
novel distributional robustness metric of detecting a known fault and a new
soft distributionally robust chance constraint that ensures robust
detectability. Then a new trade-off design scheme of fault detection under
unknown probability distributions is proposed, and this offers a flexible
balance between the robustness of detecting known critical faults and the
overall detectability against all possible faults. To solve the resulting
problem, an exact reformulation is derived and a customized solution algorithm
is developed, which includes a sequential optimization procedure and an
initialization strategy. Finally, case studies on a simulated three-tank system
and a real-world battery cell are carried out to showcase the usefulness of our
DRFD method.

                                        <span>  Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MLFD) is a class of interacting particle
methods that tackle convex optimization over probability measures on a
manifold, which are scalable, versatile, and enjoy computational guarantees.
However, some important problems -- such as risk minimization for infinite
width two-layer neural networks, or sparse deconvolution -- are originally
defined over the set of signed, rather than probability, measures. In this
paper, we investigate how to extend the MFLD framework to convex optimization
problems over signed measures. Among two known reductions from signed to
probability measures -- the lifting and the bilevel approaches -- we show that
the bilevel reduction leads to stronger guarantees and faster rates (at the
price of a higher per-iteration complexity). In particular, we investigate the
convergence rate of MFLD applied to the bilevel reduction in the low-noise
regime and obtain two results. First, this dynamics is amenable to an annealing
schedule, adapted from Suzuki et al. (2023), that results in improved
convergence rates to a fixed multiplicative accuracy. Second, we investigate
the problem of learning a single neuron with the bilevel approach and obtain
local exponential convergence rates that depend polynomially on the dimension
and noise level (to compare with the exponential dependence that would result
from prior analyses).

                                        <span>  In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a
surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian
process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization
problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent
receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is
encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the
objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average
regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of
the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is
applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is
constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our
bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the
communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with
numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating
the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.

for Merton's portfolio problem, unifying modern neural-network-based policy
parameterization with the costate (adjoint) viewpoint from Pontryagin's Maximum
Principle (PMP). Instead of approximating the value function (as in "Deep
BSDE"), we track a policy-fixed backward SDE for the adjoint variables,
allowing each gradient update to align with continuous-time PMP conditions.
This setup yields locally optimal consumption and investment policies that are
closely tied to classical stochastic control. We further incorporate an
alignment penalty that nudges the learned policy toward Pontryagin-derived
solutions, enhancing both convergence speed and training stability. Numerical
experiments confirm that PG-DPO effectively accommodates both consumption and
investment, achieving strong performance and interpretability without requiring
large offline datasets or model-free reinforcement learning.

modeling uncertainty that serves as a middle ground between the optimistic
approach, which adopts a distributional belief, and the pessimistic
distributionally robust optimization approach, which hedges against
distributional ambiguity. We equip the TRO model with a TRO ambiguity set
characterized by a size parameter controlling the level of optimism and a shape
parameter representing distributional ambiguity. We first show that
constructing the TRO ambiguity set using a general star-shaped shape parameter
with the empirical distribution as its star center is necessary and sufficient
to guarantee the hierarchical structure of the sequence of TRO ambiguity sets.
Then, we analyze the properties of the TRO model, including quantifying
conservatism, quantifying bias and generalization error, and establishing
asymptotic properties. Specifically, we show that the TRO model could generate
a spectrum of decisions, ranging from optimistic to conservative decisions.
Additionally, we show that it could produce an unbiased estimator of the true
optimal value. Furthermore, we establish the almost-sure convergence of the
optimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the TRO model to their true
counterparts. We exemplify our theoretical results using an inventory control
problem and a portfolio optimization problem.

                                        <span>  Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component
of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual
fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker
detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we
perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual
quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a
relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions
yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties
that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion
representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular
structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.

                                        <span>  The unpredictable nature of outdoor settings introduces numerous safety
concerns, making hazard detection crucial for safe navigation. This paper
introduces a novel system for sidewalk safety navigation utilizing a hybrid
approach that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a One-Class Support
Vector Machine (OCSVM). The system is designed to detect anomalies on sidewalks
that could potentially pose walking hazards. A dataset comprising over 15,000
training frames and 5,000 testing frames was collected using video recordings,
capturing various sidewalk scenarios, including normal and hazardous
conditions. During deployment, the VAE utilizes its reconstruction mechanism to
detect anomalies within a frame. Poor reconstruction by the VAE implies the
presence of an anomaly, after which the OCSVM is used to confirm whether the
anomaly is hazardous or non-hazardous. The proposed VAE model demonstrated
strong performance, with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively
distinguishing anomalies that could be potential hazards. The OCSVM is employed
to reduce the detection of false hazard anomalies, such as manhole or water
valve covers. This approach achieves an accuracy of 91.4%, providing a highly
reliable system for distinguishing between hazardous and non-hazardous
scenarios. These results suggest that the proposed system offers a robust
solution for hazard detection in uncertain environments.

                                        <span>  The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the
sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can
deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also
being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for
devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force
estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a
comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter
from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge
this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output
encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from
two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and
z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to
be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from
different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to
output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it
leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in
3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for
segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single
end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with
the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation
and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
time such a model has been proposed

Generalized Bur Tree (DRGBT) algorithm, a sampling-based planner for dynamic
environments. We provide a detailed time analysis and appropriate scheduling to
facilitate a real-time operation. To this end, an extensive analysis is
conducted to identify the time-critical routines and their dependence on the
number of obstacles. Furthermore, information about the distance to obstacles
is used to compute a structure called dynamic expanded bubble of free
configuration space, which is then utilized to establish sufficient conditions
for a guaranteed safe motion of the robot while satisfying all kinematic
constraints. An extensive randomized simulation trial is conducted to compare
the proposed algorithm to a competing state-of-the-art method. Finally, an
experimental study on a real robot is carried out covering a variety of
scenarios including those with human presence. The results show the
effectiveness and feasibility of real-time execution of the proposed motion
planning algorithm within a typical sensor-based arrangement, using cheap
hardware and sequential architecture, without the necessity for GPUs or heavy
parallelization.

aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori
agreed-upon meeting location, using minimal hardware. That paper considered
differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover,
the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a
simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of
them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller
and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any
initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller
aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether
a controller exists that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In
this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the
geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation
proof of the paper above for two robots and present an alternative controller
alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.

                                        <span>  Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for
navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to
surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing
technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work
presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots;
specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for
planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot
enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of
the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a
multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic
chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into
Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision
in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show
significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas
comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when
tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.

                                        <span>  Understanding geometric, semantic, and instance information in 3D scenes from
sequential video data is essential for applications in robotics and augmented
reality. However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods
generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper,
we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric
reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a
unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified
with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color,
semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve
panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an
online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic
predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL
module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D
predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a
coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments
show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and
tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction
of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video.

                                        <span>  Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in
highly-variable, combinatorially-complex robotics domains given raw sensor
input in the form of images. Previous work has shown that one way to achieve
this aim is to learn a structured abstract transition model in the form of
symbolic predicates and operators, and then plan within this model to solve
novel tasks at test time. However, these learned models do not ground directly
into pixels from just a handful of demonstrations. In this work, we propose to
invent predicates that operate directly over input images by leveraging the
capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Our key idea is that,
given a set of demonstrations, a VLM can be used to propose a set of predicates
that are potentially relevant for decision-making and then to determine the
truth values of these predicates in both the given demonstrations and new image
inputs. We build upon an existing framework for predicate invention, which
generates feature-based predicates operating on object-centric states, to also
generate visual predicates that operate on images. Experimentally, we show that
our approach -- pix2pred -- is able to invent semantically meaningful
predicates that enable generalization to novel, complex, and long-horizon tasks
across two simulated robotic environments.

interacting with the environment through careful selection of contact sequences
and timings. However, the combinatorial nature behind contact planning hinders
the applicability of such optimization problems on hardware. In this work, we
present a novel approach that optimizes gait sequences and respective timings
for legged robots in the context of optimization-based controllers through the
use of sampling-based methods and supervised learning techniques. We propose to
bootstrap the search by learning an optimal value function in order to speed-up
the gait planning procedure making it applicable in real-time. To validate our
proposed method, we showcase its performance both in simulation and on hardware
using a 22 kg electric quadruped robot. The method is assessed on different
terrains, under external perturbations, and in comparison to a standard control
approach where the gait sequence is fixed a priori.

high-quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as
distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion
Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only
tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as
a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision
checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP
exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU.
Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph,
GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based
optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the
MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch
planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust,
scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.

human-robot interaction. Recent work has attempted to train robot policies by
interacting with dynamic virtual humans in simulated environments, where the
policies can later be transferred to the real world. However, a major
bottleneck is the reliance on human motion capture data, which is expensive to
acquire and difficult to scale to arbitrary objects and human grasping motions.
In this paper, we introduce a framework that can generate plausible human
grasping motions suitable for training the robot. To achieve this, we propose a
hand-object synthesis method that is designed to generate handover-friendly
motions similar to humans. This allows us to generate synthetic training and
testing data with 100x more objects than previous work. In our experiments, we
show that our method trained purely with synthetic data is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods that rely on real human motion data both in simulation
and on a real system. In addition, we can perform evaluations on a larger scale
compared to prior work. With our newly introduced test set, we show that our
model can better scale to a large variety of unseen objects and human motions
compared to the baselines. Project page:

                                        <span>  In this paper, we address a method that integrates reinforcement learning
into the Monte Carlo tree search to boost online path planning under fully
observable environments for automated parking tasks. Sampling-based planning
methods under high-dimensional space can be computationally expensive and
time-consuming. State evaluation methods are useful by leveraging the prior
knowledge into the search steps, making the process faster in a real-time
system. Given the fact that automated parking tasks are often executed under
complex environments, a solid but lightweight heuristic guidance is challenging
to compose in a traditional analytical way. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a reinforcement learning pipeline with a Monte Carlo tree search under
the path planning framework. By iteratively learning the value of a state and
the best action among samples from its previous cycle's outcomes, we are able
to model a value estimator and a policy generator for given states. By doing
that, we build up a balancing mechanism between exploration and exploitation,
speeding up the path planning process while maintaining its quality without
using human expert driver data.

                                        <span>  Different from most of the formation strategies where robots require unique
labels to identify topological neighbors to satisfy the predefined shape
constraints, we here study the problem of identity-less distributed shape
formation in homogeneous swarms, which is rarely studied in the literature. The
absence of identities creates a unique challenge: how to design appropriate
target formations and local behaviors that are suitable for identity-less
formation shape control. To address this challenge, we propose the following
novel results. First, to avoid using unique identities, we propose a dynamic
formation description method and solve the formation consensus of robots in a
locally distributed manner. Second, to handle identity-less distributed
formations, we propose a fully distributed control law for homogeneous swarms
based on locally sensed information. While the existing methods are applicable
to simple cases where the target formation is stationary, ours can tackle more
general maneuvering formations such as translation, rotation, or even shape
deformation. Both numerical simulation and flight experiment are presented to
verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed formation strategy.

                                        <span>  Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component
of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual
fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker
detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we
perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual
quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a
relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions
yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties
that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion
representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular
structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.

for dynamic systems taking into account possible parameter variations and
uncertainties. We have tried to solve the problem such that the model follows
the changes and variations in the system on a continuous and smooth surface.
Running the model to adaptively gain the optimum values of the parameters on a
smooth surface would facilitate further improvements in the application of
other derivative based optimization control algorithms such as MPC or robust
control algorithms to achieve a combined modeling-control scheme. Compared to
the earlier works on the smooth fuzzy modeling structures, we could reach a
desired trade-off between the model optimality and the computational load. The
proposed method has been evaluated on a test problem as well as the non-linear
dynamic of a chemical process.

packets in a real-time communication system, where a transmitter sends status
updates generated by a source to a receiver over an unreliable channel. The
timestamps of transmitted and received packets are measured using separate
clocks located at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. To account for
possible clock drift between these two clocks, we consider both deterministic
and probabilistic drift scenarios. We analyze the system's performance
regarding the Age of Information (AoI) and derive closed-form expressions for
the distribution and the average AoI under both clock drift models.
Additionally, we explore the impact of key system parameters on the average AoI
through analytical and numerical results.

traditional controllers, our innovative controller integrates modified tuning
and Lyapunov functions to guarantee stability and convergence. Furthermore, we
have implemented an event-triggered strategy aimed at reducing the frequency of

effectively. To address the challenges posed by unknown functions and
algebraic-loop problems, we opted for radial basis function neural networks
(RBF NNs), chosen for their superior performance. Our methodology successfully
mitigates Zeno's behavior and ensures stability within a narrowly defined set.
The efficacy of our proposed solution is validated through two illustrative

secondary control strategies for islanded inverter-based AC microgrids,
designed to counter a broad spectrum of energy-unbounded False Data Injection
(FDI) attacks, including exponential attacks, targeting control input channels.
While distributed control improves scalability and reliability, it also
increases susceptibility to cyber threats. The proposed strategies, supported
by rigorous Lyapunov-based proofs, ensure uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB)
convergence for frequency regulation, voltage containment, and power sharing,
even under severe cyber attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has
been demonstrated through case studies on a modified IEEE 34-bus system,
leveraging simulations and real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments with
OPAL-RT.

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear
time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories
sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic
analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process
noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp
contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing
more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For
this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can
obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are
nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results,
we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on
constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their
performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics.
Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution,
a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to
achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm
and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an
adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory
data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical
learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating
process.

aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori
agreed-upon meeting location, using minimal hardware. That paper considered
differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover,
the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a
simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of
them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller
and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any
initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller
aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether
a controller exists that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In
this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the
geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation
proof of the paper above for two robots and present an alternative controller
alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.

                                        <span>  As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro
systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges
arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but
prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study
addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage
(CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal
distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology
utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited
feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations.
Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes
energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in
geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy
generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management.
Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and
surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability
of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing
CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization
framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging
topography.

universal inverters in microgrids, designed to enhance grid stability and
flexibility. As hybrid PV-battery systems become increasingly prevalent, there
is a critical need for inverters capable of efficiently transitioning between
grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes. Our firmware introduces dual
control paths that allow for seamless transitions without reliance on external
control devices, reducing communication overhead and increasing operational
reliability. Key features include direct phase-angle detection and frequency
restoration capabilities, essential for managing asymmetrical power grids and
dynamic load changes. The efficacy of Control-Sync is demonstrated through
rigorous testing with grid emulators and multi-phase inverters, confirming its
potential to improve microgrid reliability and efficiency. This study offers a
scalable solution to enhance inverter adaptability in various grid conditions,
fostering a more resilient energy infrastructure.

                                        <span>  We study a networked economic system composed of $n$ producers supplying a
single homogeneous good to a number of geographically separated markets and of
a centralized authority, called the market maker. Producers compete \`a la
Cournot, by choosing the quantities of good to supply to each market they have
access to in order to maximize their profit. Every market is characterized by
its inverse demand functions returning the unit price of the considered good as
a function of the total available quantity. Markets are interconnected by a
dispatch network through which quantities of the considered good can flow
within finite capacity constraints. Such flows are determined by the market
maker, who aims at maximizing a designated welfare function. We model such
competition as a strategic game with $n+1$ players: the producers and the
market game. For this game, we first establish the existence of Nash equilibria
under standard concavity assumptions. We then identify sufficient conditions
for the game to be potential with an essentially unique Nash equilibrium. Next,
we present a general result that connects the optimal action of the market
maker with the capacity constraints imposed on the network. For the commonly
used Walrasian welfare, our finding proves a connection between capacity
bottlenecks in the market network and the emergence of price differences
between markets separated by saturated lines. This phenomenon is frequently
observed in real-world scenarios, for instance in power networks. Finally, we
validate the model with data from the Italian day-ahead electricity market.

                                        <span>  This article proposes a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based
reinforcement learning (RL) approach for DC-DC boost converter control that is
compared with traditional control methods. The performance of the PPO algorithm
is evaluated using MATLAB Simulink co-simulation, and the results demonstrate
that the most efficient approach for achieving short settling time and
stability is to combine the PPO algorithm with a reinforcement learning-based
control method. The simulation results show that the control method based on RL
with the PPO algorithm pro vides step response characteristics that outperform
traditional control approaches, thereby enhancing DC-DC boost converter
control. This research also highlights the inherent capability of the
reinforcement learning method to enhance the performance of boost converter
control.

for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision
processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel
fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the
compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that
the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI
algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also
consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads
to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.

                                        <span>  Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and
high-quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as
distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion
Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only
tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as
a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision
checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP
exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU.
Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph,
GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based
optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the
MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch
planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust,
scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.

time-varying systems. The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law
whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based
event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based
Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not
satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the
controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last
collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical
jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to
a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the
controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions
can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are
satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the
approach are discussed.

measurements and their statistical analysis are essential first steps towards
this direction. This paper presents a comprehensive ultra-wideband (UWB)
double-directional channel measurement campaign in a large portion of FR3 (6-14
GHz) for urban microcellular environments. We analyze over 25,000 directional
power delay profiles and providing key insights into line-of-sight (LoS) and
obstructed line-of-sight (OLoS) conditions. This is followed by statistical
modeling of path loss, shadowing, delay spread and angular spread. As the first
UWB double-directional measurement campaign in this frequency range, this work
offers critical insights for spectrum allocation, channel modeling, and the
design of advanced communication systems, paving the way for further
exploration of FR3.

control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first
present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP
reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and
controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence
results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and
regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results
involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite
window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present
several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously
establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.

excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the
edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the
nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the
weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected
layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting
sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the
origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured
and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability
requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in
particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and
generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and
topologies.

                                        <span>  The design space of dynamic multibody systems (MBSs), particularly those with
flexible components, is considerably large. Consequently, having a means to
efficiently explore this space and find the optimum solution within a feasible
timeframe is crucial. It is well known that for problems with several design
variables, sensitivity analysis using the adjoint variable method extensively
reduces the computational costs. This paper presents the novel extension of the
discrete adjoint variable method to the design optimization of dynamic flexible
MBSs. The extension involves deriving the adjoint equations directly from the
discrete, rather than the continuous, equations of motion. This results in a
system of algebraic equations that is computationally less demanding to solve
compared to the system of differential algebraic equations produced by the
continuous adjoint variable method. To describe the proposed method, it is
integrated with a numerical time-stepping algorithm based on geometric
variational integrators. The developed technique is then applied to the
optimization of MBSs composed of springs, dampers, beams and rigid bodies,
considering both geometrical (e.g., positions of joints) and non-geometrical
(e.g., mechanical properties of components) design variables. To validate the
developed methods and show their applicability, three numerical examples are
provided.

difference) between the optimal solutions (resp. optimal values) of convex
integer programs (IP) and the optimal solutions (resp. optimal values) of their
continuous relaxations. We show that these values can be upper bounded in terms
of the recession cone of the feasible region of the continuous relaxation when
the recession cone is full-dimensional. If the recession cone is not
full-dimensional we give sufficient conditions to obtain a finite integrality
gap. We then specialize our analysis to second-order conic IPs. In the case the
feasible region is defined by a single Lorentz cone constraint, we give upper
bounds on proximity and integrality gap in terms of the data of the problem
(the objective function vector, the matrix defining the conic constraint, the
right-hand side, and the covering radius of a related lattice). We also give
conditions for these bounds to be independent of the right-hand side, akin to
the linear IP case. Finally, in the case the feasible region is defined by
multiple Lorentz cone constraints, we show that, in general, we cannot give
bounds that are independent of the corresponding right-hand side. Although our
results are presented for the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$, the bounds can be
easily adapted to work for any general lattice, including the usual
mixed-integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$, by considering
the appropriate covering radius when needed.

prompts tailored to the domains of Adaptive and Robust Optimization. Then, we
show that using these prompts, ChatGPT is able to (i) formulate an optimization
problem, (ii) adapt the problem so that it accounts for user-specified

the problem and (iv) produce executable code that solves the problem. For
simple Optimization Problems, we show that ChatGPT is able to perform these
steps with little to no errors. We also highlight some instances of erroneous
execution of the steps. Overall, we show that using in-context learning,
ChatGPT has the potential to adapt to higlhy specialized and niche domains, in
which it would otherwise demonstrate very poor out-of-the-box performance.

                                        <span>  In minimax optimization, the extragradient (EG) method has been extensively
studied because it outperforms the gradient descent-ascent method in
convex-concave (C-C) problems. Yet, stochastic EG (SEG) has seen limited
success in C-C problems, especially for unconstrained cases. Motivated by the
recent progress of shuffling-based stochastic methods, we investigate the
convergence of shuffling-based SEG in unconstrained finite-sum minimax
problems, in search of convergent shuffling-based SEG. Our analysis reveals
that both random reshuffling and the recently proposed flip-flop shuffling
alone can suffer divergence in C-C problems. However, with an additional simple
trick called anchoring, we develop the SEG with flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA)
method which successfully converges in C-C problems. We also show upper and
lower bounds in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, demonstrating
that SEG-FFA has a provably faster convergence rate compared to other
shuffling-based methods.

                                        <span>  Recently, the square root principal component pursuit (SRPCP) model has
garnered significant research interest. It is shown in the literature that the
SRPCP model guarantees robust matrix recovery with a universal, constant
penalty parameter. While its statistical advantages are well-documented, the
computational aspects from an optimization perspective remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we focus on developing efficient optimization
algorithms for solving the SRPCP problem. Specifically, we propose a
tuning-free alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm, where each iteration
involves subproblems enjoying closed-form optimal solutions. Additionally, we
introduce techniques based on the variational formulation of the nuclear norm
and Burer-Monteiro decomposition to further accelerate the AltMin method.
Extensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and robustness of our
algorithms.

                                        <span>  Direct search methods are a class of popular global optimization algorithms
for general nonconvex programs. In this paper, we propose a randomized
directional search algorithm (RDSA) for globally solving nonconvex optimization
problems. The convergence of RDSA to a global optimizer is established and its
computational complexity is derived. Additionally, IRDSA is proposed as an
improved algorithm of RDSA. We then apply both RDSA and IRDSA to nonconvex
programs with multiple local optima. Results demonstrate that RDSA and IRDSA
exhibit remarkable efficacy to identify the global optimum and outperform other
global optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness.

of its fundamental properties, characterization, and examples that can be used
for their recognition and optimization. Next, the convergence analysis of the
projected subgradient methods with several step-sizes (i.e., constant,
nonsummable, square-summable but not summable, geometrically decaying, and
Scaled Polyak's step-sizes) to global minima for this class of functions is
studied. In particular, the convergence rate of the proposed methods is
investigated under paraconvexity and the H\"{o}lderian error bound condition,
where the latter is an extension of the classical error bound condition. The
preliminary numerical experiments on several robust low-rank matrix recovery
problems (i.e., robust matrix completion, image inpainting, robust nonnegative
matrix factorization, robust matrix compression) indicate promising behavior
for these projected subgradient methods, validating our theoretical
foundations.

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear
time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories
sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic
analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process
noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp
contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing
more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For
this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can
obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are
nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results,
we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on
constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their
performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics.
Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution,
a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to
achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm
and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an
adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory
data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical
learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating
process.

                                        <span>  High-order tensor methods that employ Taylor-based local models of positive
integer degree $p$ within adaptive regularization frameworks have recently
garnered significant research interest for both convex and nonconvex
optimization problems. The well-known $p$th-order adaptive regularization
(AR$p$) method has demonstrated optimal worst-case global convergence rates and
local convergence rates. At each iteration of this method, a local model of the
objective function, consisting of a $p$th-order Taylor approximation and a
$(p+1)$th-order regularization term, is minimized. However, for $p \geq 2$, the
subproblem typically contains multiple local minima. It is recommended to solve
the subproblem globally when $p = 2$, as the global minimizer is guaranteed to
be a descent direction. However, for any $p \geq 3$, it remains an open
question how to efficiently minimize the subproblem and which minimizer to
select. In this context, designing efficient AR$p$ variants is a critical area
of interest, especially for $p \geq 3$. In this paper, we extend the
interpolation-based updating strategies, originally introduced by Gould,
Porcelli, and Toint in 2012 for $p = 2$, to cases where $p \geq 3$. This
updating strategy enables the regularization parameter to adjust adaptively
based on interpolation models. We propose a novel prerejection mechanism that
rejects unwanted subproblem minimizers prior to any function evaluations,
thereby reducing computational costs for $p\geq 3$. Numerical results
illustrate how the proposed interpolation-based updating strategy and the
prerejection mechanism for $p = 3$ enhance the overall numerical performance.

                                        <span>  In optimizing real-world structures, due to fabrication or budgetary
restraints, the design variables may be restricted to a set of standard
engineering choices. Such variables, commonly called categorical variables, are
discrete and unordered in essence, precluding the utilization of gradient-based
optimizers for the problems containing them. In this paper, incorporating the
Gumbel-Softmax (GSM) method, we propose a new gradient-based optimizer for
handling such variables in the optimal design of large-scale frame structures.
The GSM method provides a means to draw differentiable samples from categorical
distributions, thereby enabling sensitivity analysis for the variables
generated from such distributions. The sensitivity information can greatly
reduce the computational cost of traversing high-dimensional and discrete
design spaces in comparison to employing gradient-free optimization methods. In
addition, since the developed optimizer is gradient-based, it can naturally
handle the simultaneous optimization of categorical and continuous design
variables. Through three numerical case studies, different aspects of the
proposed optimizer are studied and its advantages over population-based
optimizers, specifically a genetic algorithm, are demonstrated.

sub-network that shares channels with a parent network. We approach the
sequential channel allocation problem using a restless multi-armed bandits
(RMAB) framework. Our objective is to maximize the expected discounted return
over an infinite horizon while minimizing interference to the parent network
caused by shared channels with the sub-network. Due to the unavailability of
direct observations of the true channel state, we leverage the channel quality
indicator (CQI) feedback provided by users. However, the RMAB problem is widely
acknowledged as PSPACE-hard even for finite-state models. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a closed-form channel index function using an iterative
online approximation method to approximate the well-known Whittle index policy,
which offers a low-complexity solution for ranking the available channels that
has an infinite state space. Through extensive numerical simulation
experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our
proposed algorithm.

on-demand directional routes for pick-up and drop-off in a grid network of
wider area with low density, followed by fixed routes in areas with demand.
Mathematical formulation for generalized costs demonstrates its benefits, with
indicators proposed to select existing bus routes for conversion with the
options of zonal express and parallel routes. Simulations on modeled scenarios

                                        <span>  Recently, cutting-plane methods such as GCP-CROWN have been explored to
enhance neural network verifiers and made significant advances. However,
GCP-CROWN currently relies on generic cutting planes (cuts) generated from
external mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. Due to the poor scalability
of MIP solvers, large neural networks cannot benefit from these cutting planes.
In this paper, we exploit the structure of the neural network verification
problem to generate efficient and scalable cutting planes specific for this
problem setting. We propose a novel approach, Branch-and-bound Inferred Cuts
with COnstraint Strengthening (BICCOS), which leverages the logical
relationships of neurons within verified subproblems in the branch-and-bound
search tree, and we introduce cuts that preclude these relationships in other
subproblems. We develop a mechanism that assigns influence scores to neurons in
each path to allow the strengthening of these cuts. Furthermore, we design a
multi-tree search technique to identify more cuts, effectively narrowing the
search space and accelerating the BaB algorithm. Our results demonstrate that
BICCOS can generate hundreds of useful cuts during the branch-and-bound process
and consistently increase the number of verifiable instances compared to other
state-of-the-art neural network verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks,
including large networks that previous cutting plane methods could not scale
to. BICCOS is part of the $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN verifier, the VNN-COMP 2024
winner. The code is available at http://github.com/Lemutisme/BICCOS .

                                        <span>  We study a networked economic system composed of $n$ producers supplying a
single homogeneous good to a number of geographically separated markets and of
a centralized authority, called the market maker. Producers compete \`a la
Cournot, by choosing the quantities of good to supply to each market they have
access to in order to maximize their profit. Every market is characterized by
its inverse demand functions returning the unit price of the considered good as
a function of the total available quantity. Markets are interconnected by a
dispatch network through which quantities of the considered good can flow
within finite capacity constraints. Such flows are determined by the market
maker, who aims at maximizing a designated welfare function. We model such
competition as a strategic game with $n+1$ players: the producers and the
market game. For this game, we first establish the existence of Nash equilibria
under standard concavity assumptions. We then identify sufficient conditions
for the game to be potential with an essentially unique Nash equilibrium. Next,
we present a general result that connects the optimal action of the market
maker with the capacity constraints imposed on the network. For the commonly
used Walrasian welfare, our finding proves a connection between capacity
bottlenecks in the market network and the emergence of price differences
between markets separated by saturated lines. This phenomenon is frequently
observed in real-world scenarios, for instance in power networks. Finally, we
validate the model with data from the Italian day-ahead electricity market.

                                        <span>  This paper investigates a class of stochastic bilevel optimization problems
where the upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded
smoothness and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. These problems have
significant applications in sequential data learning, such as text
classification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is
characterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling
linearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing
state-of-the-art algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ oracle calls
of stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an
$\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further
improve the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the
population level also hold for each random realization almost surely (e.g.,
Lipschitzness of each realization of the stochastic gradient). To address this
issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm named AccBO.
The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized stochastic
gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level variable by the
stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with averaging. We
prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Our proof
relies on a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov
accelerated gradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high
probability for the lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and
also plays a crucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over
time. Experimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm
achieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms
baselines in bilevel optimization.

                                        <span>  Inspired by the recent work by Shapiro et al. [45], we propose a Bayesian
distributionally robust Nash equilibrium (BDRNE) model where each player lacks
complete information on the true probability distribution of the underlying
uncertainty represented by a random variable and subsequently determines the
optimal decision by solving a Bayesian distributionally robust optimization
(BDRO) problem under the Nash conjecture. Unlike most of the DRO models in the
literature, the BDRO model assumes (a) the true unknown distribution of the
random variable can be approximated by a randomized parametric family of
distributions, (b) the average of the worst-case expected value of the
objective function with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter,
instead of the worst-case expected value of the objective function is
considered in each player's decision making, and (c) the posterior distribution
of the parameter is updated as more and more sampling information of the random
variable is gathered. Under some moderate conditions, we demonstrate the
existence of a BDRNE and derive asymptotic convergence of the equilibrium as
the sample size increases. Moreover, we propose to solve the BDRNE problem by
Gauss-Seidel-type iterative method in the case when the ambiguity set of each
player is constructed via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Finally, we apply
the BDRNE model to a price competition problem under multinomial logit demand.
The preliminary numerical test results show that the proposed model and
computational scheme perform well.

                                        <span>  In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal
control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first
present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP
reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and
controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence
results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and
regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results
involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite
window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present
several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously
establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.

                                        <span>  We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial
excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the
edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the
nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the
weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected
layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting
sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the
origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured
and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability
requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in
particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and
generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and
topologies.

                                        <span>  Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires
real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,
collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Most modern
trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because
high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be
systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the
potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based
planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free
planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph
search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in
real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern
optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and
several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible.
Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components
that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art
optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate
trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters)
with low computation times (milliseconds).

                                        <span>  This paper investigates a novel nonlinear update rule based on temporal
difference (TD) errors in reinforcement learning (RL). The update rule in the
standard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of
updates, treating all rewards equally without no bias. On the other hand, the
recent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD
error and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic.
Such biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and
intentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this
research explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity
between the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a
control as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation
encompassing various RL and optimal control methods. In particular, we
investigate the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded
in the derivation of the standard RL from control as inference. By analyzing
it, Weber-Fechner law (WFL) is found, namely, perception (a.k.a. the degree of
updates) in response to stimulus change (a.k.a. TD error) is attenuated by
increase in the stimulus intensity (a.k.a. the value function). To numerically
reveal the utilities of WFL on RL, we then propose a practical implementation
using a reward-punishment framework and modifying the definition of optimality.
Analysis of this implementation reveals that two utilities can be expected i)
to increase rewards to a certain level early, and ii) to sufficiently suppress
punishment. We finally investigate and discuss the expected utilities through
simulations and robot experiments. As a result, the proposed RL algorithm with
WFL shows the expected utilities that accelerate the reward-maximizing startup
and continue to suppress punishments during learning.

manipulation strategies, can provide key guidance for tasks ranging from
robotic gripper design to the development of manipulation algorithms. The
existing grasp and manipulation taxonomies, however, often assume object
rigidity, which limits their ability to reason about the complex interactions
in the robotic manipulation of deformable objects. Hence, to assist in tasks
involving deformable objects, taxonomies need to capture more comprehensively
the interactions inherent in deformable object manipulation. To this end, we
introduce T-DOM, a taxonomy that analyses key aspects involved in the
manipulation of deformable objects, such as robot motion, forces, prehensile
and non-prehensile interactions and, for the first time, a detailed
classification of object deformations. To evaluate T-DOM, we curate a dataset
of ten tasks involving a variety of deformable objects, such as garments,
ropes, and surgical gloves, as well as diverse types of deformations. We
analyse the proposed tasks comparing the T-DOM taxonomy with previous well
established manipulation taxonomies. Our analysis demonstrates that T-DOM can
effectively distinguish between manipulation skills that were not identified in
other taxonomies, across different deformable objects and manipulation actions,
offering new categories to characterize a skill. The proposed taxonomy
significantly extends past work, providing a more fine-grained classification
that can be used to describe the robotic manipulation of deformable objects.
This work establishes a foundation for advancing deformable object
manipulation, bridging theoretical understanding and practical implementation
in robotic systems.

                                        <span>  Robotic applications require a comprehensive understanding of the scene. In
recent years, neural fields-based approaches that parameterize the entire
environment have become popular. These approaches are promising due to their
continuous nature and their ability to learn scene priors. However, the use of
neural fields in robotics becomes challenging when dealing with unknown sensor
poses and sequential measurements. This paper focuses on the problem of sensor
pose estimation for large-scale neural implicit SLAM. We investigate implicit
mapping from a probabilistic perspective and propose hierarchical pose
estimation with a corresponding neural network architecture. Our method is
well-suited for large-scale implicit map representations. The proposed approach
operates on consecutive outdoor LiDAR scans and achieves accurate pose
estimation, while maintaining stable mapping quality for both short and long
trajectories. We built our method on a structured and sparse implicit
representation suitable for large-scale reconstruction and evaluated it using
the KITTI and MaiCity datasets. Our approach outperforms the baseline in terms
of mapping with unknown poses and achieves state-of-the-art localization
accuracy.

                                        <span>  In situ robotic automation in construction is challenging due to constantly
changing environments, a shortage of robotic experts, and a lack of
standardized frameworks bridging robotics and construction practices. This work
proposes a holistic framework for construction task specification, optimization
of robot morphology, and mission execution using a mobile modular
reconfigurable robot. Users can specify and monitor the desired robot behavior
through a graphical interface. Our framework identifies an optimized robot
morphology and enables automatic real-world execution by integrating Building
Information Modelling (BIM). By leveraging modular robot components, we ensure
seamless and fast adaption to the specific demands of the construction task.
Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach robustly enables the
autonomous execution of robotic drilling.

                                        <span>  Transparent objects are ubiquitous in daily life, making their perception and
robotics manipulation important. However, they present a major challenge due to
their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately
estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for
transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the
refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our
method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and
independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we
model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a
unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction
that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By
integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we
show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects,
using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel
transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior
refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D
datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose
estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task. The

researchers, as collecting natural interaction data in the wild is
time-consuming and logistically challenging. The problem is exacerbated by
robots' different form factors and interaction modalities. Inspired by recent
work on ethnomethodological and conversation analysis (EMCA) in the domain of
HRI, we propose ReStory, a method that has the potential to augment existing
in-the-wild human-robot interaction datasets leveraging Vision Language Models.
While still requiring human supervision, ReStory is capable of synthesizing
human-interpretable interaction scenarios in the form of storyboards. We hope
our proposed approach provides HRI researchers and interaction designers with a
new angle to utilizing their valuable and scarce data.

                                        <span>  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on accurate trajectory prediction of
surrounding vehicles to ensure the safety of both passengers and other road
users. Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each
requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately
capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on
accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However
current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always
ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal
prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we
introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that
combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning
algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics
Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage
focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling
interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO
facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental
results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous
Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that
DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and
long-term prediction horizons.

human sense of touch to detect stimuli. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs)
are promising for their ability to provide rich information, robustness,
adaptability, low cost, and multimodal capabilities. However, current
technologies still have limitations in sensitivity, spatial resolution, and the
high computational demands of deep learning-based image processing. This paper
presents a comprehensive approach combining a novel sensor structure with
micromachined structures and an efficient image processing method, and
demonstrates that carefully engineered microstructures within the sensor
hardware can significantly enhance sensitivity while reducing computational
load. Unlike traditional designs with tracking markers, our sensor incorporates
an interface surface with micromachined trenches, as an example of
microstructures, which modulate light transmission and amplify the variation in
response to applied force. By capturing variations in brightness, wire width,
and cross pattern locations with a camera, the sensor accurately infers the
contact location, the magnitude of displacement and applied force with a
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). Theoretical and experimental
results demonstrated that the microstructures significantly enhance sensitivity
by amplifying the visual effects of shape distortion. The sensor system
effectively detected forces below 10 mN, and achieved a millimetre-level
single-point spatial resolution. Using a model with only one convolutional

mounted with a stereo camera approaching an unsignalized T-intersection. A
mathematical model for uncertainty in stereo camera depth measurements is
considered and an analysis establishes the proposed adaptive depth sampling
logic which guarantees an upper bound on the computed closing speed. Further, a
collision avoidance logic is proposed that utilizes the closing speed bound and
generates a safe trajectory plan based on the convex hull property of a
quadratic B\'ezier curve-based reference path. Realistic validation studies are
presented with neighboring vehicle trajectories generated using Next Generation

                                        <span>  Air-ground collaborative robots have shown great potential in the field of
fire and rescue, which can quickly respond to rescue needs and improve the
efficiency of task execution. Mapping and navigation, as the key foundation for
air-ground collaborative robots to achieve efficient task execution, have
attracted a great deal of attention. This growing interest in collaborative
robot mapping and navigation is conducive to improving the intelligence of fire
and rescue task execution, but there has been no comprehensive investigation of
this field to highlight their strengths. In this paper, we present a systematic
review of the ground-to-ground cooperative robots for fire and rescue from a
new perspective of mapping and navigation. First, an air-ground collaborative
robots framework for fire and rescue missions based on unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) mapping and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation is introduced. Then,
the research progress of mapping and navigation under this framework is
systematically summarized, including UAV mapping, UAV/UGV co-localization, and
UGV navigation, with their main achievements and limitations. Based on the
needs of fire and rescue missions, the collaborative robots with different
numbers of UAVs and UGVs are classified, and their practicality in fire and
rescue tasks is elaborated, with a focus on the discussion of their merits and
demerits. In addition, the application examples of air-ground collaborative
robots in various firefighting and rescue scenarios are given. Finally, this
paper emphasizes the current challenges and potential research opportunities,
rounding up references for practitioners and researchers willing to engage in
this vibrant area of air-ground collaborative robots.

                                        <span>  Motion capture has become increasingly important, not only in computer
animation but also in emerging fields like the virtual reality, bioinformatics,
and humanoid training. Capturing outdoor environments offers extended horizon
scenes but introduces challenges with occlusions and obstacles. Recent
approaches using multi-drone systems to capture multiple actor scenes often
fail to account for multi-view consistency and reasoning across cameras in
cluttered environments. Coordinated motion Capture (CoCap), inspired by
Conflict-Based Search (CBS), addresses this issue by coordinating view planning
to ensure multi-view reasoning during conflicts. In scenarios with high
occlusions and obstacles, where the likelihood of inter-robot collisions
increases, CoCap demonstrates performance that approaches the ideal outcomes of
unconstrained planning, outperforming existing sequential planning methods.
Additionally, CoCap offers a single-robot view search approach for real-time
applications in dense environments.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a physics enhanced residual learning (PERL) framework
for connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon control, addressing the
dynamics and unpredictability inherent to platoon systems. The framework first
develops a physics-based controller to model vehicle dynamics, using driving
speed as input to optimize safety and efficiency. Then the residual controller,
based on neural network (NN) learning, enriches the prior knowledge of the
physical model and corrects residuals caused by vehicle dynamics. By
integrating the physical model with data-driven online learning, the PERL
framework retains the interpretability and transparency of physics-based models
and enhances the adaptability and precision of data-driven learning, achieving
significant improvements in computational efficiency and control accuracy in
dynamic scenarios. Simulation and robot car platform tests demonstrate that
PERL significantly outperforms pure physical and learning models, reducing
average cumulative absolute position and speed errors by up to 58.5% and 40.1%
(physical model) and 58.4% and 47.7% (NN model). The reduced-scale robot car
platform tests further validate the adaptive PERL framework's superior accuracy
and rapid convergence under dynamic disturbances, reducing position and speed
cumulative errors by 72.73% and 99.05% (physical model) and 64.71% and 72.58%
(NN model). PERL enhances platoon control performance through online parameter
updates when external disturbances are detected. Results demonstrate the
advanced framework's exceptional accuracy and rapid convergence capabilities,
proving its effectiveness in maintaining platoon stability under diverse
conditions.

high-altitude inspection, welding, and cleaning tasks due to their ability to
perform various operations against gravity on vertical or inclined walls.
However, during operation, the robot may experience overturning torque caused
by its own weight and load, which can lead to the detachment of magnetic plates
and subsequently pose safety risks. This paper proposes an improved ICNN-LSTM
network classification method based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
attitude sensor data for real-time monitoring and assessment of hazardous
states in magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots. Firstly, a data
acquisition strategy for attitude sensors capable of capturing minute
vibrations is designed. Secondly, a feature extraction and classification model
combining an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Experimental validation
demonstrates that the proposed minute vibration sensing method achieves
significant results, and the proposed classification model consistently
exhibits high accuracy compared to other models. The research findings provide
effective technical support for the safe operation of climbing robots

collaboration. Despite its significance, the development and maintenance of an
optimal trust level are obstructed by the complex nature of influencing factors
and their mechanisms. This study investigates the effects of cognitive load on
human trust within the context of a hybrid human-robot collaboration task. An
experiment is conducted where the humans and the robot, acting as team members,
collaboratively construct pyramids with differentiated levels of task
complexity. Our findings reveal that cognitive load exerts diverse impacts on
human trust in the robot. Notably, there is an increase in human trust under
conditions of high cognitive load. Furthermore, the rewards for performance are
substantially higher in tasks with high cognitive load compared to those with
low cognitive load, and a significant correlation exists between human trust
and the failure risk of performance in tasks with low and medium cognitive
load. By integrating interdependent task steps, this research emphasizes the
unique dynamics of hybrid human-robot collaboration scenarios. The insights
gained not only contribute to understanding how cognitive load influences trust
but also assist developers in optimizing collaborative target selection and
designing more effective human-robot interfaces in such environments.

perceived understanding. This necessitates accurate and flexible responses to
various input data from the user. While systems such as this can become
increasingly complex as more states or response types are included, new
research in the application of large language models towards human-robot
interaction has allowed for more streamlined perception and reaction pipelines.
LLM-selected actions and emotional expressions can help reinforce the realism
of displayed empathy and allow for improved communication between the robot and
user. Beyond portraying empathy in spoken or written responses, this shows the
possibilities of using LLMs in actuated, real world scenarios. In this work we
extend research in LLM-driven nonverbal behavior for social robots by
considering more open-ended emotional response selection leveraging new
advances in vision-language models, along with emotionally aligned motion and
color pattern selections that strengthen conveyance of meaning and empathy.

                                        <span>  Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its
current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like
autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning
approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory
datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex
spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these
challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction
that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on
hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by
integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths
while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of
TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and
meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant
performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world
trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons
(i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and
performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components.
Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps
by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a
specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing,
applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban
centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g.,
rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational
overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete
code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for
various applications.

representation captures this critical geometric property of the local terrain
while allowing us to exploit the computational benefits of sensing and planning
in the image space. We adapt a primitive shapes-based synthetic data generation
scheme to create geometrically rich and diverse simulation scenes and extract
ground truth semantic information in order to train a steppability model. We
then integrate this steppability model into an existing interleaved graph
search and trajectory optimization-based footstep planner to demonstrate how
this steppability paradigm can inform footstep planning in complex, unknown
environments. We analyze the steppability model performance to demonstrate its
validity, and we deploy the perception-informed footstep planner both in
offline and online settings to experimentally verify planning performance.

                                        <span>  Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LS-MAS) consist of several autonomous
components, interacting in a non-trivial way, so that the emerging behaviour of
the ensemble depends on the individual dynamics of the components and their
reciprocal interactions. These models can describe a rich variety of natural
systems, as well as artificial ones, characterised by unparalleled scalability,
robustness, and flexibility. Indeed, a crucial objective is devising efficient
strategies to model and control the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS to achieve
specific goals. However, the inherent complexity of these systems and the wide
spectrum of their emerging behaviours pose significant challenges. The
overarching goal of this thesis is, therefore, to advance methods for
modelling, analyzing and controlling the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS, with
applications to cellular populations and swarm robotics. The thesis begins with
an overview of the existing Literature, and is then organized into two distinct
parts. In the context of swarm robotics, Part I deals with distributed control
algorithms to spatially organize agents on geometric patterns. The contribution
is twofold, encompassing both the development of original control algorithms,
and providing a novel formal analysis, which allows to guarantee the emergence
of specific geometric patterns. In Part II, looking at the spatial behaviours
of biological agents, experiments are carried out to study the movement of
microorganisms and their response to light stimuli. This allows the derivation
and parametrization of mathematical models that capture these behaviours, and
pave the way for the development of innovative approaches for the spatial
control of microorganisms. The results presented in the thesis were developed
by leveraging formal analytical tools, simulations, and experiments, using
innovative platforms and original computational frameworks.

autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments. Inspired by the key
principles of the brain-predictive coding and the Bayesian brain-we propose a
novel stochastic Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Biases (RNNPB). The
proposed model incorporates stochasticity into the latent space using the
reparameterization trick used in variational autoencoders. This approach
enables the model to learn probabilistic representations of multidimensional
sequences, capturing uncertainty and enhancing robustness against overfitting.
We tested the proposed model on a robotic motion dataset to assess its
performance in generating and recognizing temporal patterns. The experimental
results showed that the stochastic RNNPB model outperformed its deterministic
counterpart in generating and recognizing motion sequences. The results
highlighted the proposed model's capability to quantify and adjust uncertainty
during both learning and inference. The stochasticity resulted in a continuous
latent space representation, facilitating stable motion generation and enhanced
generalization when recognizing novel sequences. Our approach provides a
biologically inspired framework for modeling temporal patterns and advances the
development of robust and adaptable systems in artificial intelligence and
robotics.

rugged terrain with the former being the focus of roboticists; a focus that has
recently been changing. This focus has led to significant performance and
understanding in jumping robots but with limited practical applications as they
require significant time between jumps to store energy, thus relegating jumping
to a secondary role in locomotion. Hopping locomotion, however, can preserve
and transfer energy to subsequent hops without long energy storage periods.
However, incorporating the performance observed in jumping systems into their
hopping counterparts is an ongoing challenge. To date, hopping robots typically
operate around 1 meter with a maximum of 1.63 m whereas jumping robots have
reached heights of 30 m. This is due to the added design and control complexity
inherent in developing a system able to input and store the necessary energy
while withstanding the forces involved and managing the system's state. Here we
report hopping robot design principles for efficient, robust, high-specific
energy, and high-energy input systems through analytical, simulation, and
experimental results. The resulting robot (MultiMo-MHR) can hop over 4 meters
($\sim$2.4x the current state-of-the-art) and is designed to withstand impact
at terminal velocity ($\geq 30.7$ m).

                                        <span>  Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive signal that is used in the
recognition of hand movement patterns, the diagnosis of diseases, and the
robust control of prostheses. Despite the remarkable success of recent
end-to-end Deep Learning approaches, they are still limited by the need for
large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the requirement for big data, we
propose utilizing a feature-imitating network (FIN) for closed-form temporal
feature learning over a 300ms signal window on Ninapro DB2, and applying it to
the task of 17 hand movement recognition. We implement a lightweight LSTM-FIN
network to imitate four standard temporal features (entropy, root mean square,
variance, simple square integral). We observed that the LSTM-FIN network can
achieve up to 99\% R2 accuracy in feature reconstruction and 80\% accuracy in
hand movement recognition. Our results also showed that the model can be
robustly applied for both within- and cross-subject movement recognition, as
well as simulated low-latency environments. Overall, our work demonstrates the
potential of the FIN modeling paradigm in data-scarce scenarios for sEMG signal
processing.

                                        <span>  Current simulators lack the ability to accurately model integrated
environments that encompass sea, air, and land. To address this gap, we
introduce Aerial-Aquatic Manipulators (AAMs) in SEa, Air, and Land Simulator
(SEALS), a comprehensive and photorealistic simulator designed for AAMs to
operate and learn in these diverse environments. The development of AAM-SEALS
tackles several significant challenges, including the creation of integrated
controllers for flying, swimming, and manipulation, and the high-fidelity
simulation of aerial dynamics and hydrodynamics leveraging particle physics.
Our evaluation demonstrates smooth operation and photorealistic transitions
across air, water, and their interfaces. We quantitatively validate the
fidelity of particle-based hydrodynamics by comparing position-tracking errors
across real-world and simulated systems. AAM-SEALS promises to benefit a broad
range of robotics communities, including robot learning, aerial robotics,
underwater robotics, mobile manipulation, and robotic simulators. We will
open-source our code and data to foster the advancement of research in these
fields. Please access our project website at:

                                        <span>  Existing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) independently make driving
decisions, but they face two significant limitations. First, in complex
scenarios, ADS may misinterpret the environment and make inappropriate driving
decisions. Second, these systems are unable to incorporate human driving
preferences in their decision-making processes. This paper proposes
Autoware$.$Flex, a novel ADS system that incorporates human input into the
driving process, allowing users to guide the ADS in making more appropriate
decisions and ensuring their preferences are satisfied. Achieving this needs to
address two key challenges: (1) translating human instructions, expressed in
natural language, into a format the ADS can understand, and (2) ensuring these
instructions are executed safely and consistently within the ADS' s
decision-making framework. For the first challenge, we employ a Large Language
Model (LLM) assisted by an ADS-specialized knowledge base to enhance
domain-specific translation. For the second challenge, we design a validation
mechanism to ensure that human instructions result in safe and consistent
driving behavior. Experiments conducted on both simulators and a real-world
autonomous vehicle demonstrate that Autoware$.$Flex effectively interprets
human instructions and executes them safely.

                                        <span>  The second generation of Robotic Operating System, ROS 2, has gained much
attention for its potential to be used for safety-critical robotic
applications. The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and
scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some
pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of
processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded
executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not
been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a
comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2
multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default
scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present
priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the
default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and
constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback
groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and
schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results
demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times
under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not
only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical
bounds.

efficiency of whole-body control for humanoid robots, a challenge accentuated
by their high degrees of freedom. The reduced-dimension rigid body dynamics of
a floating base robot is constructed by segmenting its kinematic chain into
constrained and unconstrained chains, simplifying the dynamics of the
unconstrained chain through the centroidal dynamics. The proposed dynamics
model is possible to be applied to whole-body control methods, allowing the
problem to be divided into two parts for more efficient computation. The
efficiency of the framework is demonstrated by comparative experiments in
simulations. The calculation results demonstrate a significant reduction in
processing time, highlighting an improvement over the times reported in current
methodologies. Additionally, the results also shows the computational
efficiency increases as the degrees of freedom of robot model increases.

exploration. Unforeseen events often require human operators to adjust mobility
plans, but this approach does not scale and will be insufficient for future
missions. Interest in self-reliant rovers is increasing, however the research
community has not yet given significant attention to autonomous, adaptive
decision-making. In this paper, we look back at specific planetary mobility
operations where human-guided adaptive planning played an important role in
mission safety and productivity. Inspired by the abilities of human experts, we
identify shortcomings of existing autonomous mobility algorithms for robots
operating in off-road environments like planetary surfaces. We advocate for
adaptive decision-making capabilities such as unassisted learning from past
experiences and more reliance on stochastic world models. The aim of this work
is to highlight promising research avenues to enhance ground planning tools
and, ultimately, long-range autonomy algorithms on board planetary rovers.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics
applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language
comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such
as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these
models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel
framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners
for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner
that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household
scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The
generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are
subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the
optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative
self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation
learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and
bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which
further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate
LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark
for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than
a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing
significantly improved alignment with human preferences. Project page:

                                        <span>  Controlling nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems involves substantial
challenges when the dynamics contain unknown and unstructured nonlinear
state-dependent terms. For such complex systems, deep neural networks can serve
as powerful black box approximators for the unknown drift and diffusion
processes. Recent developments construct Lyapunov-based deep neural network
(Lb-DNN) controllers to compensate for deterministic uncertainties using
adaptive weight update laws derived from a Lyapunov-based analysis based on
insights from the compositional structure of the DNN architecture. However,
these Lb-DNN controllers do not account for non-deterministic uncertainties.
This paper develops Lb-DNNs to adaptively compensate for both the drift and
diffusion uncertainties of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems. Through a
Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a DNN-based approximation and corresponding
DNN weight adaptation laws are constructed to eliminate the unknown
state-dependent terms resulting from the nonlinear diffusion and drift
processes. The tracking error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded in
probability. Simulations are performed on a nonlinear stochastic dynamical
system to show efficacy of the proposed method.

                                        <span>  Mobile edge computing (MEC) has empowered mobile devices (MDs) in supporting
artificial intelligence (AI) applications through collaborative efforts with
proximal MEC servers. Unfortunately, despite the great promise of device-edge
cooperative AI inference, data privacy becomes an increasing concern. In this
paper, we develop a privacy-aware multi-device cooperative edge inference
system for classification tasks, which integrates a distributed bidding
mechanism for the MEC server's computational resources. Intermediate feature
compression is adopted as a principled approach to minimize data privacy
leakage. To determine the bidding values and feature compression ratios in a
distributed fashion, we formulate a decentralized partially observable Markov
decision process (DEC-POMDP) model, for which, a multi-agent deep deterministic
policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in privacy-preserving
cooperative edge inference. Specifically, given a sufficient level of data
privacy protection, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.31-0.95% improvements in
classification accuracy compared to the approach being agnostic to the wireless
channel conditions. The performance is further enhanced by 1.54-1.67% by
considering the difficulties of inference data.

personal tablet is used to advise the driver to follow a target eco-speed via a
screen. Two Renault Zoe electric cars, one equipped with the different modules
for ED and one without, are used to perform field tests on a route between
Rueil-Malmaison and Bougival in France. Overall, the ED consumed, on average,
4.6~$\%$ less energy than the non-eco-driven car with a maximum of 2~$\%$
change in average speed.

                                        <span>  Policy iteration is one of the classical frameworks of reinforcement
learning, which requires a known initial stabilizing control. However, finding
the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax
this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two
different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and
variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear
systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is
gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients.
This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number
of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy
$\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping
coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current
estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect
data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the
traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by
simulation.

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are increasing demands on monitoring
flying objects at low altitude in wide urban areas. In this work, the widely
deployed long-term evolution (LTE) base station (BS) is exploited to illuminate
UAVs in bistatic trajectory tracking. Specifically, a passive sensing receiver
with two digital antenna arrays is proposed and developed to capture both the
line-of-sight (LoS) signal and the scattered signal off a target UAV. From
their cross ambiguity function, the bistatic range, Doppler shift and
angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the target UAV can be detected in a sequence of time
slots. In order to address missed detections and false alarms of passive
sensing, a multi-target tracking framework is adopted to track the trajectory
of the target UAV. It is demonstrated by experiments that the proposed UAV
tracking system can achieve a meter-level accuracy.

integrating the physical model with data-driven online learning, the PERL
framework retains the interpretability and transparency of physics-based models
and enhances the adaptability and precision of data-driven learning, achieving
significant improvements in computational efficiency and control accuracy in
dynamic scenarios. Simulation and robot car platform tests demonstrate that
PERL significantly outperforms pure physical and learning models, reducing
average cumulative absolute position and speed errors by up to 58.5% and 40.1%
(physical model) and 58.4% and 47.7% (NN model). The reduced-scale robot car
platform tests further validate the adaptive PERL framework's superior accuracy
and rapid convergence under dynamic disturbances, reducing position and speed
cumulative errors by 72.73% and 99.05% (physical model) and 64.71% and 72.58%
(NN model). PERL enhances platoon control performance through online parameter
updates when external disturbances are detected. Results demonstrate the
advanced framework's exceptional accuracy and rapid convergence capabilities,
proving its effectiveness in maintaining platoon stability under diverse
conditions.

mixed traffic of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), high-occupancy vehicles
(HOVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), with a goal to avoid flow breakdown
and minimize total social cost. A mesoscopic finite-difference traffic
simulation model considers the flow-density relationship at different CAV
market penetration rates, lane-changing behavior, and multiple entries/exits,
interacting with a reactive toll setting mechanism. The results of the Monte
Carlo simulation suggest an optimal policy of untolled HOV/CAV use with HDV
tolls in particular scenarios of limited CAV market penetration. Small and
targeted tolling avoids flow breakdown in ML while prioritizing HOVs and other
vehicles with high values of time. Extensions of the formulation and
sensitivity analysis quantify the benefits of converting high-occupancy HDVs to
CAVs. The optimal tolling regime combines traffic science notions of flow
stability and the economics of resource allocation.

student run mission to design and fly a cubesat to study fluid sloshing in
spacecraft. The project will examine zero-g propellant sloshing from an
experimental standpoint. Despite the small size and limited payload capacity,
we intend to use the cubesat platform to mimic larger spacecraft and implement
novel detection and computer vision methods in our analysis. Many modern
spacecraft rely on propellant-filled tanks to perform attitude control and
station-keeping maneuvers. When a large percentage of the spacecraft's mass is
comprised of liquid propellant, sloshing becomes a critical aspect of
spacecraft attitude control and stability. The mission will study the
tank/fluid dynamics using new methods to gain an enhanced understanding of
low-gravity fluid disturbance effects and improve simulations using equivalent
mechanical models (EMMs). Active control of the fluid leading to the reduction
of propellant slosh settling times will improve the maneuverability and
performance of spacecraft. This paper will focus on satellite payload research
and design requirements used to inform other aspects of the SPICEsat design. In
this paper, mission objectives will be discussed, numerical simulations for the
proposed control algorithms are demonstrated, and a satellite experiment design
is presented. Finally, we examine computational fluid dynamics models to
validate the satellite design and propellant sensing components of the proposed
spacecraft.

Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.

nonlinear systems, with linear error dynamics and assignable poles. Sufficient
conditions for functional observability are first derived, leading to
functional relationships between the Lie derivatives of the output to be
estimated and the ones of the measured output. These are directly used in the
proposed design of the functional observer. The functional observer is defined
in differential input-output form, satisfying an appropriate invariance
condition that emerges from the state-space invariance conditions of the
literature. A concept of functional observer index is also proposed, to
characterize the lowest feasible order of functional observer with pole
assignment. Two chemical reactor applications are used to illustrate the
proposed approach.

                                        <span>  Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LS-MAS) consist of several autonomous
components, interacting in a non-trivial way, so that the emerging behaviour of
the ensemble depends on the individual dynamics of the components and their
reciprocal interactions. These models can describe a rich variety of natural
systems, as well as artificial ones, characterised by unparalleled scalability,
robustness, and flexibility. Indeed, a crucial objective is devising efficient
strategies to model and control the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS to achieve
specific goals. However, the inherent complexity of these systems and the wide
spectrum of their emerging behaviours pose significant challenges. The
overarching goal of this thesis is, therefore, to advance methods for
modelling, analyzing and controlling the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS, with
applications to cellular populations and swarm robotics. The thesis begins with
an overview of the existing Literature, and is then organized into two distinct
parts. In the context of swarm robotics, Part I deals with distributed control
algorithms to spatially organize agents on geometric patterns. The contribution
is twofold, encompassing both the development of original control algorithms,
and providing a novel formal analysis, which allows to guarantee the emergence
of specific geometric patterns. In Part II, looking at the spatial behaviours
of biological agents, experiments are carried out to study the movement of
microorganisms and their response to light stimuli. This allows the derivation
and parametrization of mathematical models that capture these behaviours, and
pave the way for the development of innovative approaches for the spatial
control of microorganisms. The results presented in the thesis were developed
by leveraging formal analytical tools, simulations, and experiments, using
innovative platforms and original computational frameworks.

                                        <span>  In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining
firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines
the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is
influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local
weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption
data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal
autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that,
surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not directly
correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary
influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also
respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T&D) charges - commonly
referred to as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges - during the summer months.
As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed
electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic
datasets to understand the overall impact on the power grid. The developed
model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the
flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population
of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed
rewards. These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are
ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified
SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents'
strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics
to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work
so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and
intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use
of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov
function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium
with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the
Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by
the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. Additionally, we derive
anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the
instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing
us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the
corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response
models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.

                                        <span>  We study a multi-agent decision problem in large population games. Agents
from multiple populations select strategies for repeated interactions with one
another. At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making
model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an
underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the
Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays,
conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may
result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an
equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the
Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an
algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across
a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis
techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash
equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are
subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a
two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.

                                        <span>  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control algorithm with strong
stability and robustness guarantees. Despite its popularity in robotics and
industrial applications, the main challenge in deploying MPC is its high
computation cost, stemming from the need to solve an optimisation problem at
each control interval. There are several methods to reduce this cost. This
survey focusses on approaches where a neural network is used to approximate an
existing controller. Herein, relevant and unique neural approximation methods
for linear, nonlinear, and robust MPC are presented and compared. Comparisons
are based on the theoretical guarantees that are preserved, the factor by which
the original controller is sped up, and the size of problem that a framework is
applicable to. Research contributions include: a taxonomy that organises
existing knowledge, a summary of literary gaps, discussion on promising
research directions, and simple guidelines for choosing an approximation
framework. The main conclusions are that (1) new benchmarking tools are needed
to help prove the generalisability and scalability of approximation frameworks,
(2) future breakthroughs most likely lie in the development of ties between
control and learning, and (3) the potential and applicability of recently
developed neural architectures and tools remains unexplored in this field.

                                        <span>  Understanding output variance is critical in modeling nonlinear dynamic
systems, as it reflects the system's sensitivity to input variations and
feature interactions. This work presents a methodology for dynamically
determining relevance scores in black-box models while ensuring
interpretability through an embedded decision module. This interpretable
module, integrated into the first layer of the model, employs the Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM) and logistic regression to compute relevance scores,
interpreted as the probabilities of input neurons being active based on their
contribution to the output variance. The proposed method leverages a
gradient-based framework to uncover the importance of variance-driven features,
capturing both individual contributions and complex feature interactions. These
relevance scores are applied through element-wise transformations of the
inputs, enabling the black-box model to prioritize features dynamically based
on their impact on system output. This approach effectively bridges
interpretability with the intricate modeling of nonlinear dynamics and
time-dependent interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the method's
ability to infer feature interactions while achieving superior performance in
feature relevance compared to existing techniques. The practical utility of
this approach is showcased through its application to an industrial pH
neutralization process, where critical system dynamics are uncovered.

attention for its potential to be used for safety-critical robotic
applications. The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and
scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some
pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of
processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded
executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not
been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a
comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2
multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default
scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present
priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the
default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and
constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback
groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and
schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results
demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times
under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not
only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical
bounds.

                                        <span>  An appropriate choice of batch sizes in large-scale model training is
crucial, yet it involves an intrinsic yet inevitable dilemma: large-batch
training improves training efficiency in terms of memory utilization, while
generalization performance often deteriorates due to small amounts of gradient
noise. Despite this dilemma, the common practice of choosing batch sizes in
language model training often prioritizes training efficiency -- employing
either constant large sizes with data parallelism or implementing batch size
warmup schedules. However, such batch size schedule designs remain heuristic
and often fail to adapt to training dynamics, presenting the challenge of
designing adaptive batch size schedules. Given the abundance of available
datasets and the data-hungry nature of language models, data parallelism has
become an indispensable distributed training paradigm, enabling the use of
larger batch sizes for gradient computation. However, vanilla data parallelism
requires replicas of model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states at each
worker, which prohibits training larger models with billions of parameters. To
optimize memory usage, more advanced parallelism strategies must be employed.
In this work, we propose general-purpose and theoretically principled adaptive
batch size schedules compatible with data parallelism and model parallelism. We
develop a practical implementation with PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel,
facilitating the pretraining of language models of different sizes. We
empirically demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform constant batch
sizes and heuristic batch size warmup schedules in the pretraining of models in
the Llama family, with particular focus on smaller models with up to 3 billion
parameters. We also establish theoretical convergence guarantees for such
adaptive batch size schedules with Adam for general smooth nonconvex
objectives.

                                        <span>  In modern engineering scenarios, there is often a strict upper bound on the
number of algorithm iterations that can be performed within a given time limit.
This raises the question of optimal algorithmic configuration for a fixed and
finite iteration budget. In this work, we introduce the framework of finite
horizon optimization, which focuses on optimizing the algorithm performance
under a strict iteration budget $T$. We apply this framework to linear
programming (LP) and propose Finite Horizon stepsize rule for the primal-dual
method. The main challenge in the stepsize design is controlling the singular
values of $T$ cumulative product of non-symmetric matrices, which appears to be
a highly nonconvex problem, and there are very few helpful tools. Fortunately,
in the special case of the primal-dual method, we find that the optimal
stepsize design problem admits hidden convexity, and we propose a convex
semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation. This SDP only involves matrix
constraints of size $4 \times 4$ and can be solved efficiently in negligible
time. Theoretical acceleration guarantee is also provided at the pre-fixed
$T$-th iteration, but with no asymptotic guarantee. On more than 90 real-world
LP instances, Finite Horizon stepsize rule reaches an average 3.9$\times$
speed-up over the optimal constant stepsize, saving 75\% wall-clock time. Our
numerical results reveal substantial room for improvement when we abandon
asymptotic guarantees, and instead focus on the performance under finite
horizon. We highlight that the benefits are not merely theoretical - they
translate directly into computational speed-up on real-world problems.

probability distribution on $X$, and $\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel''
which may be singular as $x\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak
solutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal
diffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative
entropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in
terms of $\eta$ and $\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the
space of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure,
thereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \emph{Otto calculus}
originally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of
equations $(\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck
equations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows
of the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and
the $W_{2}$ metric.
  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and
uniqueness of solutions to ($\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions;
stability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence, with
respect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\pi$, and
transition kernel $\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to
equilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as
well as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme
in the $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.

                                        <span>  In this work, we consider the following 2D stochastic convective
Brinkman-Forchheimer (SCBF) equations in a bounded smooth domain $\mathcal{O}$:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{u}+\left[-\mu
\Delta\boldsymbol{u}+(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}+\alpha\boldsymbol{u}+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}+\nabla
p\right]\mathrm{d}t=\sqrt{\mathrm{Q}}\mathrm{W}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0,
  \end{align*}
  where $\mu,\alpha,\beta>0$, $r\in\{1,2,3\}$, $\mathrm{Q}$ is a non-negative
operator of trace class, $\mathrm{W}$ is a cylindrical Wiener process in a
Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$. Under the following assumption on the viscosity
co-efficient $\mu$ and the Darcy co-efficient $\alpha$: for some positive
constant $\gamma_1$,
  \begin{equation*}
  \mu(\mu+\alpha)^2>\gamma_1\max\{4\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{Q}),\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{A}^{2\delta}\mathrm{Q})\},
  \end{equation*}
  where $\mathrm{A}$ is the Stokes operator and $\delta\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$, our
primary goal is to solve the corresponding Kolmogorov equation in the space
$\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{H};\eta),$ where $\eta$ is the unique invariant measure
associated with 2D SCBF equations. Then, we establish the well-known ``carr\'e
du champs'' identity. Some sharp estimates on the derivatives of the solution
constitute the key component of the proofs. We take into consideration two
control problems from the application point of view. The first is an infinite
horizon control problem for which we establish the existence of a solution for
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with it. Finally, by exploiting
$m$-accretive theory, we demonstrate the existence of a unique solution for an
obstacle problem associated with the Kolmogorov operator corresponding to the
stopping-time problem for 2D SCBF equations.

decreasing, where $r$, $|\cdot|$ and $h$ stand for the inradius, the measure
and the Cheeger constant and $(\Omega_t)$ for parallel bodies of $\Omega$. The
result is shown to not hold when the convexity assumption is dropped. We also
prove the differentiability of the map $t\longmapsto h(\Omega_t)$ in any
dimension and without any regularity assumption on $\Omega$, obtaining an
explicit formula for the derivative. Those results are then combined to obtain
estimates on the contact surface of the Cheeger sets of convex bodies. Finally,
potential generalizations to other functionals such as the first eigenvalue of
the Dirichlet Laplacian are explored.

control randomisation framework, where we substitute the control process with
an independent Poisson point process, controlling its intensity instead. To
address the challenges posed by the mean-field interactions in this
randomisation approach, we reformulate the admissible control as L 0 -valued
processes adapted only to the common noise. We then construct the randomised
control problem from this reformulated control process, and show its
equivalence to the original MFC problem. Thanks to this equivalence, we can
represent the value function as the minimal solution to a backward stochastic
differential equation (BSDE) with constrained jumps. Finally, using this
probabilistic representation, we derive a randomised dynamic programming
principle (DPP) for the value function, expressed as a supremum over equivalent
probability measures.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we study the two-stage distributionally robust optimization
(DRO) problem from the primal perspective. Unlike existing approaches, this
perspective allows us to build a deeper and more intuitive understanding on
DRO, to leverage classical and well-established solution methods and to develop
a general and fast decomposition algorithm (and its variants), and to address a
couple of unsolved issues that are critical for modeling and computation.
Theoretical analyses regarding the strength, convergence, and iteration
complexity of the developed algorithm are also presented. A numerical study on
different types of instances of the distributionally robust facility location
problem demonstrates that the proposed solution algorithm (and its variants)
significantly outperforms existing methods. It solves instances up to several
orders of magnitude faster, and successfully addresses new types of practical
instances that previously could not be handled. We believe these results will
significantly enhance the accessibility of DRO, break down barriers, and
unleash its potential to solve real world challenges.

                                        <span>  We consider the Restricted Inverse Optimal Value Problem (RIOVSP) on trees
under weighted bottleneck Hamming distance, denoted as (RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). The
problem aims to minimize the total cost under weighted bottle-neck Hamming
distance such that the length of the shortest root-leaf path of the tree is
lower-bounded by a given value by adjusting the length of some edges.
Additionally, the specified lower bound must correspond to the length of a
particular root-leaf path. Through careful analysis of the problem's structural
properties, we develop an algorithm with $O(n\log n)$ time complexity to solve
(RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). Furthermore, by removing the path-length constraint, we
derive the Minimum Cost Shortest Path Interdiction Problem on Trees (MCSPIT),
for which we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm that operates under
weighted bottleneck Hamming distance. Extensive computational experiments
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of both algorithms.

                                        <span>  The integration of optimization problems within neural network architectures
represents a fundamental shift from traditional approaches to handling
constraints in deep learning. While it is long known that neural networks can
incorporate soft constraints with techniques such as regularization, strict
adherence to hard constraints is generally more difficult. A recent advance in
this field, however, has addressed this problem by enabling the direct
embedding of optimization layers as differentiable components within deep
networks. This paper surveys the evolution and current state of this approach,
from early implementations limited to quadratic programming, to more recent
frameworks supporting general convex optimization problems. We provide a
comprehensive review of the background, theoretical foundations, and emerging
applications of this technology. Our analysis includes detailed mathematical
proofs and an examination of various use cases that demonstrate the potential
of this hybrid approach. This work synthesizes developments at the intersection
of optimization theory and deep learning, offering insights into both current
capabilities and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

mixed traffic of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), high-occupancy vehicles
(HOVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), with a goal to avoid flow breakdown
and minimize total social cost. A mesoscopic finite-difference traffic
simulation model considers the flow-density relationship at different CAV
market penetration rates, lane-changing behavior, and multiple entries/exits,
interacting with a reactive toll setting mechanism. The results of the Monte
Carlo simulation suggest an optimal policy of untolled HOV/CAV use with HDV
tolls in particular scenarios of limited CAV market penetration. Small and
targeted tolling avoids flow breakdown in ML while prioritizing HOVs and other
vehicles with high values of time. Extensions of the formulation and
sensitivity analysis quantify the benefits of converting high-occupancy HDVs to
CAVs. The optimal tolling regime combines traffic science notions of flow
stability and the economics of resource allocation.

of mean-field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). Here, the
weighting matrices in the cost functional are allowed to be indefinite.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are obtained via a
mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). By
investigating the connections with LQ problems of mean-field forward systems
and taking some limiting procedures, we establish the solvabilities of
corresponding Riccati equations in the case that cost functional is uniformly
convex. Subsequently, an explicit formula of optimal control and optimal cost
are derived. Moreover, some sufficient conditions for the uniform convexity of
cost functional are also proposed in terms of Riccati equations, which have not
been considered in existing literatures for backward systems. Some examples are
provided to illustrate our results.

inversion to meet growing performance demands. Here, we establish necessary and

nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure.
Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.

                                        <span>  This paper develops a computational framework based on a car-following model
to study traffic instability and lane changes. Building upon Newell's classical
first-order car-following model, we show that, both analytically and
numerically, there exists a vehicle-density-dependent critical reaction time
that determines the stability of single-lane traffic. Specifically,
perturbations to the equilibrium system decay with time for low reaction time
and grow for high reaction time. This critical reaction time converges to
Newell's original result in the continuum limit. Additionally, we propose a
psychology-based lane-changing mechanism that builds a quantitative connection
between the driver's psychological factor (frustration level) and the driving
condition. We show that our stochastic lane-changing model can faithfully
reproduce interesting phenomena like load-balancing of different lanes. Our
model supports the result that more frequent lane changes only marginally
benefit the driver's overall velocity.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes risk-averse and risk-agnostic formulations to robust
design in which solutions that satisfy the system requirements for a set of
scenarios are pursued. These scenarios, which correspond to realizations of
uncertain parameters or varying operating conditions, can be obtained either
experimentally or synthetically. The proposed designs are made robust to
variations in the training data by considering perturbed scenarios. This
practice allows accounting for error and uncertainty in the measurements,
thereby preventing data overfitting. Furthermore, we use relaxation to
trade-off a lower optimal objective value against lesser robustness to
uncertainty. This is attained by eliminating a given number of optimally chosen
outliers from the dataset, and by allowing for the perturbed scenarios to
violate the requirements with an acceptably small probability. For instance, we
can pursue a riskier design that attains a lower objective value in exchange
for a few scenarios violating the requirements, or we might seek a more
conservative design that satisfies the requirements for as many perturbed
scenarios as possible. The design of a flexible wing subject to aeroelastic
constraints is used for illustration.

                                        <span>  Community detection, also known as graph partitioning, is a well-known
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in diverse fields
such as complex network theory, transportation, and smart power grids. The
problem's solution space grows drastically with the number of vertices and
subgroups, making efficient algorithms crucial. In recent years, quantum
computing has emerged as a promising approach to tackling NP-hard problems.
This study explores the use of a quantum-inspired algorithm, Simulated
Bifurcation (SB), for community detection. Modularity is employed as both the
objective function and a metric to evaluate the solutions. The community
detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling seamless integration with the SB
algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that SB effectively identifies
community structures in benchmark networks such as Zachary's Karate Club and
the IEEE 33-bus system. Remarkably, SB achieved the highest modularity,
matching the performance of Fujitsu's Digital Annealer, while surpassing
results obtained from two quantum machines, D-Wave and IBM. These findings
highlight the potential of Simulated Bifurcation as a powerful tool for solving
community detection problems.

stochastic integer model designed for optimizing the deployment of charging
stations under uncertainty. A key contribution of this work is incorporating
additional constraints accounting for congestion management at charging
stations. The solution approach combines a greedy heuristic with a
branch-and-price algorithm, enabling the efficient handling of medium
instances. In the branch-and-price algorithm, when the solution to the
restricted master problem is not integer, a greedy heuristic and a local search
procedure are conducted to obtain feasible solutions. Computational experiments
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

introduce a mixed parallel computing strategy that processes linear constraints
first, then handles other conic constraints in parallel. This mixed parallel
computing strategy currently supports linear, second-order cone, exponential
cone, and power cone constraints. We demonstrate that integrating a mixed
parallel computing strategy with GPU-based direct linear system solvers
enhances the performance of GPU-based conic solvers, surpassing their CPU-based

that employing mixed-precision linear system solvers can potentially achieve

for solving hybrid (i.e., a blend of smooth and nonsmooth) weakly convex
composite optimization (HWC-CO) problems. This is done in a unified manner by
considering a proximal bundle framework (PBF) based on a generic bundle update
framework which includes various well-known bundle update schemes. In contrast
to hard-to-check stationary conditions (e.g., the Moreau stationarity) used by
other methods for solving HWC-CO, PBF uses a stationarity measure which is

optimization problem is considered. The model arises from the acoustic full
waveform inversion in the time domain. The analysis is mainly challenging due
to the involved hyperbolicity and second-order bilinear structure. This
notorious character leads to an undesired effect of loss of regularity in the
SQP method, calling for a substantial extension of developed parabolic
techniques. We propose and analyze a novel strategy for the well-posedness and
convergence analysis based on the use of a smooth-in-time initial condition, a
tailored self-mapping operator, and a two-step estimation process along with
Stampacchia's method for second-order wave equations. Our final theoretical
result is the R-superlinear convergence of the SQP method.

                                        <span>  This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be
nonlinear in probability. Our primary goal is to establish central limit
theorems for these functionals when mixed estimators are employed. Our study is
relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts
and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning methods. A
generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which
encompasses most of the known coherent risk measures including systemic
measures of risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze
vector-valued functionals, providing a framework for evaluating
high-dimensional risks. This framework facilitates the comparison of multiple
risk measures, as well as the estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic
risk and its optimal value in decision-making problems. Second, we derive novel
central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals when mixed types of
estimators: empirical and smoothed estimators are used. We provide verifiable
sufficient conditions for the central limit formulae and show their
applicability to several popular measures of risk.

accelerated algorithm for multiobjective optimization problems. The strategy
focuses on solving the problem of Lipschitz constant being unknown. It allows
estimate parameter updates non-increasingly. Furthermore, the proposed strategy
effectively avoids the limitation in convergence proofs arising from the
non-negativity of the auxiliary sequence, thus providing a theoretical
guarantee for its performance. We demonstrate that, under relatively mild
assumptions, the algorithm achieves the convergence rate of $O(1/k2)$.

difficult to optimize efficiently due to their combinatorial nature. This work
presents a method to cope with hybrid optimal control problems which, in
contrast to decomposition techniques, does not require relaxing the integrality
constraints. Based on the discretize-then-optimize approach, our scheme
addresses mixed-integer nonlinear problems under mild assumptions. The proposed
numerical algorithm builds upon the augmented Lagrangian framework, whose
subproblems are handled using successive mixed-integer linearizations with
trust regions. We validate the performance of the numerical routine with
extensive investigations using hybrid optimal control problems from different
fields of application. Promising preliminary results are presented for a motion
planning task with hysteresis and a Lotka-Volterra fishing problem with total
variation.

stochastic control with regime-switching. The representative agent adjusts the
dynamics of a Markov-modulated It\^o-diffusion via a two-sided singular
stochastic control and faces a long-time-average expected profit criterion. The
mean-field interaction is of scalar type and it is given through the stationary
distribution of the population. Via a constructive approach, we prove the
existence and uniqueness of the stationary mean-field equilibrium. Furthermore,
we show that this realizes a symmetric $\varepsilon_N$-Nash equilibrium for a
suitable ergodic $N$-player game with singular controls. The proof hinges on
the characterization of the optimal solution to the representative player's
ergodic singular stochastic control problem with regime switching in terms of
an auxiliary Dynkin game, which is of independent interest and appears here for
the first time.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population
of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed
rewards. These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are
ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified
SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents'
strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics
to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work
so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and
intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use
of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov
function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium
with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the
Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by
the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. Additionally, we derive
anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the
instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing
us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the
corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response
models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.

                                        <span>  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control algorithm with strong
stability and robustness guarantees. Despite its popularity in robotics and
industrial applications, the main challenge in deploying MPC is its high
computation cost, stemming from the need to solve an optimisation problem at
each control interval. There are several methods to reduce this cost. This
survey focusses on approaches where a neural network is used to approximate an
existing controller. Herein, relevant and unique neural approximation methods
for linear, nonlinear, and robust MPC are presented and compared. Comparisons
are based on the theoretical guarantees that are preserved, the factor by which
the original controller is sped up, and the size of problem that a framework is
applicable to. Research contributions include: a taxonomy that organises
existing knowledge, a summary of literary gaps, discussion on promising
research directions, and simple guidelines for choosing an approximation
framework. The main conclusions are that (1) new benchmarking tools are needed
to help prove the generalisability and scalability of approximation frameworks,
(2) future breakthroughs most likely lie in the development of ties between
control and learning, and (3) the potential and applicability of recently
developed neural architectures and tools remains unexplored in this field.

                                        <span>  We consider (stochastic) subgradient methods for strongly convex but
potentially nonsmooth non-Lipschitz optimization. We provide new equivalent
dual descriptions (in the style of dual averaging) for the classic subgradient
method, the proximal subgradient method, and the switching subgradient method.
These equivalences enable $O(1/T)$ convergence guarantees in terms of both
their classic primal gap and a not previously analyzed dual gap for strongly
convex optimization. Consequently, our theory provides these classic methods
with simple, optimal stopping criteria and optimality certificates at no added
computational cost. Our results apply to a wide range of stepsize selections
and of non-Lipschitz ill-conditioned problems where the early iterations of the
subgradient method may diverge exponentially quickly (a phenomenon which, to
the best of our knowledge, no prior works address). Even in the presence of
such undesirable behaviors, our theory still ensures and bounds eventual
convergence.

computing NE, fictitious play (FP) has being receiving incessant research
attention and finding games where FP would converge (games with FPP) is one
central question in related fields. In this paper, we identify a new class of
games with FPP, i.e., $3\times3$ games without IIP, based on the geometrical
approach by leveraging the location of NE and the partition of best response
region. During the process, we devise a new projection mapping to reduce a
high-dimensional dynamical system to a planar system. And to overcome the
non-smoothness of the systems, we redefine the concepts of saddle and sink NE,
which are proven to exist and help prove the convergence of CFP by separating
the projected space into two parts. Furthermore, we show that our projection
mapping can be extended to higher-dimensional and degenerate games.

lost-in-a-forest problem. The forest boundary is known and may take any shape.
The starting point and the orientation are unspecified. We convert the problem
into translation and rotation of the forest boundary. This transformation
allows us to formulate this problem as a constrained minimization problem. Upon
discretization, the problem becomes a variation of the traveling salesman
problem or the Hamiltonian path problem. We leverage discrete optimization and
derive several nontrivial results consistent with those from previous papers.
This method is general, and we also extend the approach to related problems,
including Moser's worm problem and the shortest opaque set problem.

class of multi-dimensional quasi-linear parabolic equations. The considered
system is driven by a leader control and two follower controls. For each leader
control, a pair of follower controls is searched for as a Nash
quasi-equilibrium (or Nash equilibrium) of cost functionals, while the aim for
a leader control is to solve a controllability problem. This hierarchic control
problem may be transformed into controllability of a strongly coupled system of
quasi-linear parabolic equations through one control. Regarding controllability
for quasi-linear parabolic equations of second order, the existing results
usually require coefficients in principal parts to be independent of gradient
of solutions, or spacial dimension to be limited. In this paper, the
coefficients in principal parts for the controlled quasi-linear system contain
not only the state itself but also its gradient with general spacial dimension.

leverage recent advances in explainable AI for probabilistic ICP methods that
provide uncertainty estimates. Concretely, we propose a method that can explain
why a probabilistic ICP method produced a particular output. Our method is
based on kernel SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). With this, we assign an
importance value to common sources of uncertainty in ICP such as sensor noise,
occlusion, and ambiguous environments. The results of the experiment show that
this explanation method can reasonably explain the uncertainty sources,
providing a step towards robots that know when and why they failed in a human

                                        <span>  This work in the field of developmental cognitive robotics aims to devise a
new domain bridging between reinforcement learning and imitation learning, with
a model of the intrinsic motivation for learning agents to learn with guidance
from tutors multiple tasks, including sequential tasks. The main contribution
has been to propose a common formulation of intrinsic motivation based on
empirical progress for a learning agent to choose automatically its learning
curriculum by actively choosing its learning strategy for simple or sequential
tasks: which task to learn, between autonomous exploration or imitation
learning, between low-level actions or task decomposition, between several
tutors. The originality is to design a learner that benefits not only passively
from data provided by tutors, but to actively choose when to request tutoring
and what and whom to ask. The learner is thus more robust to the quality of the
tutoring and learns faster with fewer demonstrations. We developed the
framework of socially guided intrinsic motivation with machine learning
algorithms to learn multiple tasks by taking advantage of the generalisability
properties of human demonstrations in a passive manner or in an active manner
through requests of demonstrations from the best tutor for simple and composing
subtasks. The latter relies on a representation of subtask composition proposed
for a construction process, which should be refined by representations used for
observational processes of analysing human movements and activities of daily
living. With the outlook of a language-like communication with the tutor, we
investigated the emergence of a symbolic representation of the continuous
sensorimotor space and of tasks using intrinsic motivation. We proposed within
the reinforcement learning framework, a reward function for interacting with
tutors for automatic curriculum learning in multi-task learning.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we explore the paradox of trust and vulnerability in
human-machine interactions, inspired by Alexander Reben's BlabDroid project.
This project used small, unassuming robots that actively engaged with people,
successfully eliciting personal thoughts or secrets from individuals, often
more effectively than human counterparts. This phenomenon raises intriguing
questions about how trust and self-disclosure operate in interactions with
machines, even in their simplest forms. We study the change of trust in
technology through analyzing the psychological processes behind such
encounters. The analysis applies theories like Social Penetration Theory and
Communication Privacy Management Theory to understand the balance between
perceived security and the risk of exposure when personal information and
secrets are shared with machines or AI. Additionally, we draw on philosophical
perspectives, such as posthumanism and phenomenology, to engage with broader
questions about trust, privacy, and vulnerability in the digital age. Rapid
incorporation of AI into our most private areas challenges us to rethink and
redefine our ethical responsibilities.

                                        <span>  In table grape cultivation, harvesting depends on accurately assessing fruit
quality. While some characteristics, like color, are visible, others, such as
Soluble Solid Content (SSC), or sugar content measured in degrees Brix
({\deg}Brix), require specific tools. SSC is a key quality factor that
correlates with ripeness, but lacks a direct causal relationship with color.
Hyperspectral cameras can estimate SSC with high accuracy under controlled
laboratory conditions, but their practicality in field environments is limited.
This study investigates the potential of simple RGB sensors under uncontrolled
lighting to estimate SSC and color, enabling cost-effective, robot-assisted
harvesting. Over the 2021 and 2022 summer seasons, we collected grape images
with corresponding SSC and color labels to evaluate algorithmic solutions for
SSC estimation on embedded devices commonly used in robotics and smartphones.
Our results demonstrate that SSC can be estimated from visual appearance with
human-like performance. We propose computationally efficient histogram-based
methods for resource-constrained robots and deep learning approaches for more
complex applications.

pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the
environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally
fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address
datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce
Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned
diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging
recent advancements in generative modeling, GODA incorporates a novel
return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based
guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution
representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with
selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited
optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated
conditioning method for processing noised inputs and conditions, enhancing the
capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark
and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to
demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across
various offline RL algorithms.

fractional-order zeroing neural network (PTC-NT-FOZNN) model, innovatively
engineered to tackle time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) challenges. The
PTC-NT-FOZNN, stemming from a novel iteration within the variable-gain ZNN
spectrum, known as FOZNNs, features diminishing gains over time and marries
noise resistance with predefined-time convergence, making it ideal for
energy-efficient robotic motion planning tasks. The PTC-NT-FOZNN enhances
traditional ZNN models by incorporating a newly developed activation function
that promotes optimal convergence irrespective of the model's order. When
evaluated against six established ZNNs, the PTC-NT-FOZNN, with parameters $0 <
\alpha \leq 1$, demonstrates enhanced positional precision and resilience to
additive noises, making it exceptionally suitable for TVQP tasks. Thorough
practical assessments, including simulations and experiments using a Flexiv
Rizon robotic arm, confirm the PTC-NT-FOZNN's capabilities in achieving precise
tracking and high computational efficiency, thereby proving its effectiveness
for robust kinematic control applications.

                                        <span>  Robot foundation models, particularly Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models,
have garnered significant attention for their ability to enhance robot policy
learning, greatly improving robot generalization and robustness. OpenAI recent
model, o1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by
utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can
robot models achieve better performance in multi-task, complex environments by
reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to
guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Chain-of-Affordance (CoA)}, a novel approach to scaling robot models by
incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to
facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the
following four types of affordances before taking action: a) object affordance
- what object to manipulate and where it is; b) grasp affordance - the specific
object part to grasp; c) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the
object; and d) movement affordance - the collision-free path for movement. By
integrating this knowledge into the policy model, the robot gains essential
context, allowing it to act with increased precision and robustness during
inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA achieves superior performance
than state-of-the-art robot foundation models, such as OpenVLA and Octo.
Additionally, CoA shows strong generalization to unseen object poses,
identifies free space, and avoids obstacles in novel environments.

                                        <span>  Near kinematic singularities of a serial manipulator, the inverse kinematics
(IK) problem becomes ill-conditioned, which poses computational problems for
the numerical solution. Computational methods to tackle this issue are based on
various forms of a pseudoinverse (PI) solution to the velocity IK problem. The
damped least squares (DLS) method provides a robust solution with controllable
convergence rate. However, at singularities, it may not even be possible to
solve the IK problem using any PI solution when certain end-effector motions
are prescribed. To overcome this problem, an analytically informed inverse
kinematics (AI-IK) method is proposed. The key step of the method is an
explicit description of the tangent aspect of singular motions (the analytic
part) to deduce a perturbation that yields a regular configuration. The latter
serves as start configuration for the iterative solution (the numeric part).

                                        <span>  Navigating dynamic and unstructured environments poses significant challenges
for autonomous robots, particularly due to the uncertainty introduced by
occluded areas. Conventional sensing methods often fail to detect obstacles
hidden behind occlusions until they are dangerously close, especially in
crowded spaces where human movement and physical barriers frequently obstruct
the robot's view. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for
occlusion-aware obstacle prediction using people as sensors, that infers the
presence of para-occluded obstacles by analyzing human behavioral patterns. Our
approach integrates sensor fusion, historical trajectory data, and predictive
modeling to estimate the likelihood of obstacle presence and occupancy in
occluded regions. By leveraging the natural tendency of humans to avoid certain
areas, the system enables robots to proactively adapt their navigation
strategies in real time. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances obstacle
prediction accuracy, reduces collision risks, and improves navigation
efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of occlusion-aware obstacle
prediction systems to improve the safety and adaptability of autonomous robots
in complex, dynamic environments.

                                        <span>  Although robotic imitation learning (RIL) is promising for embodied
intelligent robots, existing RIL approaches rely on computationally intensive
multi-model trajectory predictions, resulting in slow execution and limited
real-time responsiveness. Instead, human beings subconscious can constantly
process and store vast amounts of information from their experiences,
perceptions, and learning, allowing them to fulfill complex actions such as
riding a bike, without consciously thinking about each. Inspired by this
phenomenon in action neurology, we introduced subconscious robotic imitation
learning (SRIL), wherein cognitive offloading was combined with historical
action chunkings to reduce delays caused by model inferences, thereby
accelerating task execution. This process was further enhanced by subconscious
downsampling and pattern augmented learning policy wherein intent-rich
information was addressed with quantized sampling techniques to improve
manipulation efficiency. Experimental results demonstrated that execution
speeds of the SRIL were 100\% to 200\% faster over SOTA policies for
comprehensive dual-arm tasks, with consistently higher success rates.

                                        <span>  Many real-world multiagent learning problems involve safety concerns. In
these setups, typical safe reinforcement learning algorithms constrain agents'
behavior, limiting exploration -- a crucial component for discovering effective
cooperative multiagent behaviors. Moreover, the multiagent literature typically
models individual constraints for each agent and has yet to investigate the
benefits of using joint team constraints. In this work, we analyze these team
constraints from a theoretical and practical perspective and propose entropic
exploration for constrained multiagent reinforcement learning (E2C) to address
the exploration issue. E2C leverages observation entropy maximization to
incentivize exploration and facilitate learning safe and effective cooperative
behaviors. Experiments across increasingly complex domains show that E2C agents
match or surpass common unconstrained and constrained baselines in task
performance while reducing unsafe behaviors by up to $50\%$.

safety is often important when optimizing control policies on the embodied
systems. For complex tasks such as the control of human or humanoid control,
the high-dimensional parameter space adds complexity to the safe optimization
effort. Current safe exploration algorithms exhibit inefficiency and may even
become infeasible with large high-dimensional input spaces. Furthermore,
existing high-dimensional constrained optimization methods neglect safety in
the search process. In this paper, we propose High-dimensional Safe Bayesian
Optimization with local optimistic exploration (HdSafeBO), a novel approach
designed to handle high-dimensional sampling problems under probabilistic
safety constraints. We introduce a local optimistic strategy to efficiently and
safely optimize the objective function, providing a probabilistic safety
guarantee and a cumulative safety violation bound. Through the use of isometric
embedding, HdSafeBO addresses problems ranging from a few hundred to several
thousand dimensions while maintaining safety guarantees. To our knowledge,
HdSafeBO is the first algorithm capable of optimizing the control of
high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems with high safety probability. We also
demonstrate the real-world applicability of HdSafeBO through its use in the
safe online optimization of neural stimulation induced human motion control.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods have been increasingly explored for
robot learning. However, RL based methods often suffer from low sampling
efficiency in the exploration phase, especially for long-horizon manipulation
tasks, and generally neglect the semantic information from the task level,
resulted in a delayed convergence or even tasks failure. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Temporal-Logic-guided Hybrid policy framework (HyTL)
which leverages three-level decision layers to improve the agent's performance.
Specifically, the task specifications are encoded via linear temporal logic
(LTL) to improve performance and offer interpretability. And a waypoints
planning module is designed with the feedback from the LTL-encoded task level
as a high-level policy to improve the exploration efficiency. The middle-level
policy selects which behavior primitives to execute, and the low-level policy
specifies the corresponding parameters to interact with the environment. We
evaluate HyTL on four challenging manipulation tasks, which demonstrate its
effectiveness and interpretability. Our project is available at:

                                        <span>  We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot
navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical
obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe navigation and global asymptotic
stability (GAS) of the target location by dynamically switching between two
operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal
obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures
collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with
range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown
environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by
experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and
robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother
trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.

                                        <span>  Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization
techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality,
reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust
autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require
extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach
for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that
teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at
high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image
priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of
predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches.
Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating
distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and
decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this
approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24
hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely
predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions,
achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping
photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and
regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process
defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable
high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization
techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously
inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving
laboratories.

                                        <span>  Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned
reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and
modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and
the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable,
especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent
Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these
challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking
problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both
the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the
underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping
that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted
to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this
symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the
Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot),
and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware
approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same
number of training steps.

increasing interest due to their improving performance and applications across
various domains and tasks. However, LLMs and VLMs can produce erroneous
results, especially when a deep understanding of the problem domain is
required. For instance, when planning and perception are needed simultaneously,
these models often struggle because of difficulties in merging multi-modal
information. To address this issue, fine-tuned models are typically employed
and trained on specialized data structures representing the environment. This
approach has limited effectiveness, as it can overly complicate the context for
processing. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent architecture for embodied
task planning that operates without the need for specific data structures as
input. Instead, it uses a single image of the environment, handling free-form
domains by leveraging commonsense knowledge. We also introduce a novel, fully
automatic evaluation procedure, PG2S, designed to better assess the quality of
a plan. We validated our approach using the widely recognized ALFRED dataset,
comparing PG2S to the existing KAS metric to further evaluate the quality of
the generated plans.

interact naturally with autonomous agents through vocal and textual

pre-trained large language models (LLMs), multimodal visual language models
(VLMs), and speech recognition (SR) models to decode the high-level natural
language conversations and semantic understanding of the robot's task
environment, and abstract them to the robot's actionable commands or queries.
We performed a quantitative evaluation of our framework's natural vocal
conversation understanding with participants from different racial backgrounds
and English language accents. The participants interacted with the robot using
both spoken and textual instructional commands. Based on the logged interaction
data, our framework achieved 87.55% vocal commands decoding accuracy, 86.27%
commands execution success, and an average latency of 0.89 seconds from
receiving the participants' vocal chat commands to initiating the robot's
actual physical action. The video demonstrations of this paper can be found at

their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities.
Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders,
but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For
those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to
a wider variety of shapes.
  One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects
with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of
degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole.
Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and
minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic
and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the
surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a
supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without
holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm
expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric
modeling.

This latter constraint arises from the physical limitations of the adopted
low-thrust technology, which is commonly employed for precise, close-range
relative orbital maneuvers. The guidance and control problem is addressed in
two frameworks: centralized and distributed. The centralized approach provides
a fuel-optimal solution, but it is practical only for formations with a small
number of deputies. The distributed approach is more scalable but yields
sub-optimal solutions. In the centralized framework, the chief is a physical
satellite responsible for all calculations, while in the distributed framework,
the chief is treated as a virtual point mass orbiting the Earth, and each
deputy performs its own guidance and control calculations onboard. The study
emphasizes the spaceborne implementation of the closed-loop control system,
aiming for a reliable and automated solution to the optimal control problem. To
this end, the risk of infeasibility is mitigated through first identifying the
constraints that pose a potential threat of infeasibility, then properly
softening them. Two Model Predictive Control architectures are implemented and
compared, namely, a shrinking-horizon and a fixed-horizon schemes.
Performances, in terms of fuel expenditure and achieved control accuracy, are
analyzed on typical close-range reconfigurations requested by Earth observation
missions and are compared against different implementations proposed in the
literature.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted exploration strategy designed
specifically for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with energy-bounded
disturbances, i.e., without making any assumptions on the distribution of the
disturbances. We use classical results characterizing the set of non-falsified
parameters consistent with energy-bounded disturbances. We derive a
semidefinite program which computes an exploration strategy that guarantees a
desired accuracy of the parameter estimate. This design is based on sufficient
conditions on the spectral content of the exploration data that robustly
accounts for initial parametric uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the
applicability of the exploration strategy through a numerical example involving
an unmodeled nonlinearity.

                                        <span>  It is well established that resource failure, including robots and machines,
in a manufacturing system can result in deadlocks. This issue not only hampers
the system's performance but can also inflict significant damage on the
manufacturing process. In this paper, we present a new algorithm developed
through modeling of a manufacturing system using Petri net that ensures the
liveness of the net in the event of such a failure. To detect possible
failures, we first design a recovery subnet that is integrated into the
resource. Next, we analyze the effects of failures on each state of the network
to identify forbidden states. Finally, we propose an algorithm that optimally
adds control places and establishes new constant vectors within the network,
enabling effective management of remaining resources across different parts of
the net. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a system featuring
three manufacturing lines, demonstrating its error-free operation while
ensuring key properties such as boundedness, liveness, and performance
continuity within the net.

differential equations with state-dependent delays. We establish the existence
and uniqueness of solutions and present a discussion concerning the appropriate
phase space to define these equations. Also, we prove a version of periodic
averaging principle to these equations. This type of result was completely open

encompass others such as impulsive, dynamic equations on time scales and
difference equations, expanding their application potential. Additionally, we
apply our theoretical insights to a real-time optimization strategy, using
extremum seeking to validate the stability of an innovative algorithm under
state-dependent delays. This application confirm the relevance of our findings
in practical scenarios, offering valuable tools for advanced control system
design. Our research provides significant contributions to the mathematical

                                        <span>  This paper aims at distributed multi-agent convex optimization where the
  communications network among the agents are presented by a random
  sequence of possibly state-dependent weighted graphs. This is the first work
to consider both random arbitrary communication networks and state-dependent
interactions among agents. The state-dependent weighted random operator of the
graph is shown to be quasi-nonexpansive;
  this property neglects a priori distribution assumption
  of random communication topologies to be imposed on the operator. Therefore,
it contains more general class of
  random networks with or without asynchronous protocols. A more general
mathematical optimization
  problem than that addressed in the literature is presented, namely
minimization of a convex function over the fixed-value point set of a
quasi-nonexpansive random operator.
  A discrete-time algorithm is provided that is able to converge both almost
surely and in mean square to the global solution of the optimization problem.
Hence, as a special case,
  it reduces to a totally asynchronous algorithm for the
  distributed optimization problem. The algorithm is able to converge even if
the weighted matrix of the graph is periodic and irreducible under synchronous
protocol. Finally, a case study on a network of robots in an automated
warehouse is
  given where there is distribution dependency among random communication
graphs.

navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical
obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe navigation and global asymptotic
stability (GAS) of the target location by dynamically switching between two
operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal
obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures
collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with
range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown
environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by
experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and
robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother
trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.

has revealed specific solution structures that can be captured with data-driven
methods. This paper explores two global search problems in the circular
restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum
fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds.
These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control
profile or the use of dynamical structures. We build on our prior generative
machine learning framework to apply diffusion models to learn the conditional
probability distribution of the search problem and analyze the model's
capability to capture these structures.

in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation.
Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country
is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an
approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water
resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts
for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning
models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead
scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial
to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent
riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong
evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted
values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the
two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample
tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model
exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6,
12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108%
in the Northeast.

                                        <span>  Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned
reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and
modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and
the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable,
especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent
Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these
challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking
problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both
the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the
underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping
that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted
to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this
symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the
Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot),
and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware
approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same
number of training steps.

recommendations to travelers willing to minimize their travel times. However,
such technologies introduce new complexities, raising concerns about their
overall impact on traffic networks. This paper focuses on evaluating the effect
of navigation apps on traffic flows, particularly examining how real-time route
recommendations influence network efficiency and congestion. Using a dynamical
network flow model, we study traffic dynamics between an origin-destination
pair, where a fraction of drivers follow app recommendations while others rely
on fixed route preferences. By incorporating supply-demand mechanisms to
account for capacity and volume constraints on routes, we uncover partial
demand transfer, i.e., only a portion of the traffic demand is able to traverse
the network, while the rest builds up congestion at the origin. We prove that
the dynamics converges to a globally stable equilibrium and we provide a
detailed analysis of this equilibrium when the choices of the informed drivers
follow a logit model, correlating the emergence of partial demand transfer to
the penetration rate of navigation apps among users.

enhancing health and reducing energy consumption in these settings is a central
research focus. With the advancement of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have
emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the
indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to
employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to
thoroughly examine the connections among these approaches in the context of
human-building interaction and occupant context-aware support. The study
analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive
use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location
recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Although these systems
are broadly applied to specific content, their use in optimizing indoor
environments and energy efficiency remains limited. This gap likely arises from
the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and extensive sensor data. Traditional
recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based and
knowledge-based methods, are commonly employed. However, the more complex
challenges of optimizing indoor conditions and energy efficiency often depend
on sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques like reinforcement and deep
learning. Furthermore, this review underscores the vast potential for expanding
recommender systems and RL applications in buildings and indoor environments.
Fields ripe for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related
product recommendation, and optimization of environments tailored for specific
needs, such as sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due
to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work
explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD)
policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and
avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN)
is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce
frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean
distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can
learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based
AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize
the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are
iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization
approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional
reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for
network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that
our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN
algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.

                                        <span>  We consider a minimax problem motivated by distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) when the worst-case distribution is continuous, leading to
significant computational challenges due to the infinite-dimensional nature of
the optimization problem. Recent research has explored learning the worst-case
distribution using neural network-based generative models to address these
computational challenges but lacks algorithmic convergence guarantees. This
paper bridges this theoretical gap by presenting an iterative algorithm to
solve such a minimax problem, achieving global convergence under mild
assumptions and leveraging technical tools from vector space minimax
optimization and convex analysis in the space of continuous probability
densities. In particular, leveraging Brenier's theorem, we represent the
worst-case distribution as a transport map applied to a continuous reference
measure and reformulate the regularized discrepancy-based DRO as a minimax
problem in the Wasserstein space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
worst-case distribution can be efficiently computed using a modified
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme with sufficiently large regularization
parameters for commonly used discrepancy functions, linked to the radius of the
ambiguity set. Additionally, we derive the global convergence rate and quantify
the total number of subgradient and inexact modified JKO iterations required to
obtain approximate stationary points. These results are potentially applicable
to nonconvex and nonsmooth scenarios, with broad relevance to modern machine
learning applications.

                                        <span>  Recent findings by Cohen et al., 2021, demonstrate that when training neural
networks with full-batch gradient descent at a step size of $\eta$, the
sharpness--defined as the largest eigenvalue of the full batch
Hessian--consistently stabilizes at $2/\eta$. These results have significant
implications for convergence and generalization. Unfortunately, this was
observed not to be the case for mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
thus limiting the broader applicability of these findings. We show that SGD
trains in a different regime we call Edge of Stochastic Stability. In this
regime, what hovers at $2/\eta$ is, instead, the average over the batches of
the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian of the mini batch (MiniBS) loss--which is
always bigger than the sharpness. This implies that the sharpness is generally
lower when training with smaller batches or bigger learning rate, providing a
basis for the observed implicit regularization effect of SGD towards flatter
minima and a number of well established empirical phenomena. Additionally, we
quantify the gap between the MiniBS and the sharpness, further characterizing
this distinct training regime.

                                        <span>  The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is regarded as an MM
(Majorization-Minimization) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of
statistical models. Expanding this view, this paper demonstrates that by
choosing an appropriate probability distribution, even nonstatistical
optimization problem can be cast as a negative log-likelihood-like minimization
problem, which can be approached by an EM (or MM) algorithm. When a polynomial
objective is optimized over a simple polyhedral feasible set and an exponential
family distribution is employed, the EM algorithm can be reduced to a natural
gradient descent of the employed distribution with a constant step size. This
is demonstrated through three examples. In this paper, we demonstrate the
global convergence of specific cases with some exponential family distributions
in a general form. In instances when the feasible set is not sufficiently
simple, the use of MM algorithms can nevertheless be adequately described. When
the objective is to minimize a convex quadratic function and the constraints
are polyhedral, global convergence can also be established based on the
existing results for an entropy-like proximal point algorithm.

non-atomic selfish routing game leveraging concepts from Daganzo's cell
transmission model (CTM). Each network link is characterized by a supply and
demand mechanism that enforces capacity constraints based on current density,
providing a more accurate representation of real-world traffic phenomena. We
characterize the Wardrop equilibria and social optima of this game and identify
a previously unrecognized inefficiency in selfish routing: partially
transferring Wardrop equilibria, where only part of the exogenous flow
traverses the network.

                                        <span>  The placement problem in very large-scale integration (VLSI) is a critical
step in chip design, the goal of which is to optimize the wirelength of circuit
components within a confined area while adhering to non-overlapping
constraints. Most analytical placement models often rely on smooth
approximations, thereby sacrificing the accuracy of wirelength estimation. To
mitigate these inaccuracies, this paper introduces a novel approach that
directly optimizes the original nonsmooth wirelength and proposes an innovative
penalty model tailored for the global placement problem. Specifically, we
transform the non-overlapping constraints into rectified linear penalty
functions, allowing for a more precise formulation of the problem. Notably, we
reformulate the resultant optimization problem into an equivalent framework
resembling deep neural network training. Leveraging automatic differentiation
techniques from deep learning, we efficiently compute the subgradient of the
objective function, thus facilitating the application of stochastic subgradient
methods to solve the model. To enhance the algorithm's performance, several
advanced techniques are further introduced, leading to significant improvements
in both efficiency and solution quality. Numerical experiments conducted on
GSRC benchmark circuits demonstrate that our proposed model and algorithm
achieve significant reductions in wirelength while effectively eliminating
overlaps, highlighting its potential as a transformative advancement for
large-scale VLSI placement.

                                        <span>  Crowdsourced delivery (CSD) is an emerging business model that leverages the
underutilized or excess capacity of individual drivers to fulfill delivery
tasks. This paper presents a general formulation of a larege-scale two-sided
CSD matching problem, considering demand/supply elasticity, heterogeneous
preferences of both shippers and drivers, and task-bundling. We propose a set
of methodologies to solve this problem. First, we reveal that the
fluid-particle decomposition approach of Akamatsu and Oyama (2024) can be
extended to our general formulation. This approach decomposes the original
large-scale matching problem into a fluidly-approximated task partition problem
(master problem) and small-scale particle matching problems (sub-problems). We
propose to introduce a truthful auction mechanism to sub-problems, which
enables the observation of privately perceived costs for each shipper/driver.
Furthermore, by finding a theoretical link between auction problems and
parturbed utility theory, we succeed in accurately reflecting the information
collected from auctions to the master problem. This reduces the master problem
to a smooth convex optimization problem, theoretically guaranteeing the
computational efficiency and solution accuracy of the fluid approximation.
Second, we transform the master problem into a traffic assignment problem (TAP)
based on a task-chain network. This transformation overcomes the difficulty in
enumerating task bundles. Finally, we formulate the dual problem of the TAP,
whose decision variable is only a price/reward pattern at market equilibrium,
and develop an efficient accelerated gradient descent method. The numerical
experiments clarify that our approach drastically reduces the computational
cost of the matching problem (~700 times faster than a naive method) without
sacrificing accuracy of the optimal solution (mostly within 0.5% errors).

                                        <span>  Variational inference is a fast and scalable alternative to Markov chain
Monte Carlo and has been widely applied to posterior inference tasks in
statistics and machine learning. A traditional approach for implementing
mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is coordinate ascent variational
inference (CAVI), which relies crucially on parametric assumptions on complete
conditionals. In this paper, we introduce a novel particle-based algorithm for
mean-field variational inference, which we term PArticle VI (PAVI). Notably,
our algorithm does not rely on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals,
and it applies to the nonparametric setting. We provide non-asymptotic
finite-particle convergence guarantee for our algorithm. To our knowledge, this
is the first end-to-end guarantee for particle-based MFVI.

                                        <span>  Motivated by the success of Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm for
convex minimization problems, we examine whether it is possible to achieve
similar performance gains in the context of online learning in games. To that
end, we introduce a family of accelerated learning methods, which we call
"follow the accelerated leader" (FTXL), and which incorporates the use of
momentum within the general framework of regularized learning - and, in
particular, the exponential/multiplicative weights algorithm and its variants.
Drawing inspiration and techniques from the continuous-time analysis of
Nesterov's algorithm, we show that FTXL converges locally to strict Nash
equilibria at a superlinear rate, achieving in this way an exponential speed-up
over vanilla regularized learning methods (which, by comparison, converge to
strict equilibria at a geometric, linear rate). Importantly, FTXL maintains its
superlinear convergence rate in a broad range of feedback structures, from
deterministic, full information models to stochastic, realization-based ones,
and even when run with bandit, payoff-based information, where players are only
able to observe their individual realized payoffs.

differential equations with state-dependent delays. We establish the existence
and uniqueness of solutions and present a discussion concerning the appropriate
phase space to define these equations. Also, we prove a version of periodic
averaging principle to these equations. This type of result was completely open
in the literature. These equations involving measure bring the advantage to
encompass others such as impulsive, dynamic equations on time scales and
difference equations, expanding their application potential. Additionally, we
apply our theoretical insights to a real-time optimization strategy, using
extremum seeking to validate the stability of an innovative algorithm under
state-dependent delays. This application confirm the relevance of our findings
in practical scenarios, offering valuable tools for advanced control system
design. Our research provides significant contributions to the mathematical
field and suggests new directions for future technological developments.

                                        <span>  In this study, we consider an optimization problem with uncertainty dependent
on decision variables, which has recently attracted attention due to its
importance in machine learning and pricing applications. In this problem, the
gradient of the objective function cannot be obtained explicitly because the
decision-dependent distribution is unknown. Therefore, several zeroth-order
methods have been proposed, which obtain noisy objective values by sampling and
update the iterates. Although these existing methods have theoretical
convergence for optimization problems with decision-dependent uncertainty, they
require strong assumptions about the function and distribution or exhibit large
variances in their gradient estimators. To overcome these issues, we propose
two zeroth-order methods under mild assumptions. First, we develop a
zeroth-order method with a new one-point gradient estimator including a
variance reduction parameter. The proposed method updates the decision
variables while adjusting the variance reduction parameter. Second, we develop
a zeroth-order method with a two-point gradient estimator. There are situations
where only one-point estimators can be used, but if both one-point and
two-point estimators are available, it is more practical to use the two-point
estimator. As theoretical results, we show the convergence of our methods to
stationary points and provide the worst-case iteration and sample complexity
analysis. Our simulation experiments with real data on a retail service
application show that our methods output solutions with lower objective values
than the conventional zeroth-order methods.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces EXAdam ($\textbf{EX}$tended $\textbf{Adam}$), a novel
optimization algorithm that builds upon the widely-used Adam optimizer. EXAdam
incorporates three key enhancements: (1) new debiasing terms for improved
moment estimation, (2) a gradient-based acceleration mechanism for increased
responsiveness to the current loss landscape, and (3) a dynamic step size
formula that allows for continuous growth of the learning rate throughout
training. These innovations work synergistically to address limitations of the
original Adam algorithm, potentially offering improved convergence properties,
enhanced ability to escape saddle points, and greater robustness to
hyperparameter choices. I provide a theoretical analysis of EXAdam's components
and their interactions, highlighting the algorithm's potential advantages in
navigating complex optimization landscapes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
EXAdam's superiority over Adam, achieving 48.07% faster convergence and
yielding improvements of 4.6%, 4.13%, and 2.39% in training, validation, and
testing accuracies, respectively, when applied to a CNN trained on the CIFAR-10
dataset. While these results are promising, further empirical validation across
diverse tasks is essential to fully gauge EXAdam's efficacy. Nevertheless,
EXAdam represents a significant advancement in adaptive optimization
techniques, with promising implications for a wide range of machine learning
applications. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing development of more
efficient, adaptive, and universally applicable optimization methods in the
field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

                                        <span>  In this article, we propose a quasi-Newton method for unconstrained set
optimization problems to find its weakly minimal solutions with respect to
lower set-less ordering. The set-valued objective mapping under consideration
is given by a finite number of vector-valued functions that are twice
continuously differentiable. To find the necessary optimality condition for
weak minimal points with the help of the proposed quasi-Newton method, we use
the concept of partition and formulate a family of vector optimization
problems. The evaluation of necessary optimality condition for finding the
weakly minimal points involves the computation of the approximate Hessian of
every objective function, which is done by a quasi-Newton scheme for vector
optimization problems. In the proposed quasi-Newton method, we derive a
sequence of iterative points that exhibits convergence to a point which
satisfies the derived necessary optimality condition for weakly minimal points.
After that, we find a descent direction for a suitably chosen vector
optimization problem from this family of vector optimization problems and
update from the current iterate to the next iterate. The proposed quasi-Newton
method for set optimization problems is not a direct extension of that for
vector optimization problems, as the selected vector optimization problem
varies across the iterates. The well-definedness and convergence of the
proposed method are analyzed. The convergence of the proposed algorithm under
some regularity condition of the stationary points, a condition on
nonstationary points, the boundedness of the norm of quasi-Newton direction,
and the existence of step length that satisfies the Armijo condition are
derived. We obtain a local superlinear convergence of the proposed method under
uniform continuity of the Hessian approximation function.

has revealed specific solution structures that can be captured with data-driven
methods. This paper explores two global search problems in the circular
restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum
fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds.
These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control
profile or the use of dynamical structures. We build on our prior generative
machine learning framework to apply diffusion models to learn the conditional
probability distribution of the search problem and analyze the model's
capability to capture these structures.

such as opinion dynamics. We are interested in systems that exhibit phase
transitions i.e. non-uniqueness of stationary states for the corresponding
McKean-Vlasov PDE, in the mean field limit. We develop an efficient numerical
scheme for identifying all steady states (both stable and unstable) of the mean
field McKean-Vlasov PDE, based on a spectral Galerkin approximation combined
with a deflated Newton's method to handle the multiplicity of solutions. Having
found all possible equilibra, we formulate an optimal control strategy for
steering the dynamics towards a chosen unstable steady state. The control is
computed using iterated open-loop solvers in a receding horizon fashion. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed steady state computation and
stabilization methodology on several examples, including the noisy
Hegselmann-Krause model for opinion dynamics and the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model
from biophysics. The numerical experiments validate the ability of the approach
to capture the rich self-organization landscape of these systems and to
stabilize unstable configurations of interest. The proposed computational
framework opens up new possibilities for understanding and controlling the
collective behavior of noise-driven interacting particle systems, with
potential applications in various fields such as social dynamics, biological
synchronization, and collective behavior in physical and social systems.

positive linear operators on a possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
under linear constraints. We show that even perturbations of points in such
sets admit what resembles a Douglas factorization. Using this result, we prove
that an operator is extreme iff a corresponding set of linear operators is
dense in the space of trace-class self-adjoint operators with range contained
in the closure of the range of that operator. If the number of constraints is
finite, we show that the extreme point must be of low-rank relative to the
number of constraints and derive a purely rank-based characterization of the
extreme points.
  In the finite-dimensional setting, our results lead to a remarkably simple
characterization of the elliptope, that is, the set of correlation matrices, in
terms of the Hadamard product which allows us to characterize the set of
matrices which constitute the equality case of the Hadamard rank inequality
when the involved matrices are equal and positive semi-definite. We illustrate
the importance of our results using examples from statistics and quantum

inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by
the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing
services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the
intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning
and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting
optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for
state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper
introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem
(JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed
Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine
learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life
constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component
is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing
problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column
generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an
attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to
cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has
been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system
of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to
the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce
high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex
instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality
compared to the existing system.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network.
The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based method to minimize the
least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We
analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that
guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution.
The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts
the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on
computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ
equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible.

curves. We decompose the ED discriminant into 3 parts which are responsible for
the 3 types of behavior of the Morse points, and we find the structure of each
one. In particular we shed light on the ``atypical discriminant'' which is due
to the loss of Morse points at infinity. We find formulas for the number of
Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding 3 types of attractors when
moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.

constrained in a way that can be modeled as them lying on a Riemannian
manifold. Riemannian optimization, wherein procedures to enforce an iterative
minimizing sequence to be constrained to the manifold, is used to train such
models. At the same time, tame geometry has become a significant topological
description of nonsmooth functions that appear in the landscapes of training
neural networks and other important models with structural compositions of
continuous nonlinear functions with nonsmooth maps. In this paper, we study the
properties of such stratifiable functions on a manifold and the behavior of
retracted stochastic gradient descent, with diminishing stepsizes, for
minimizing such functions.

time that can be assigned in advance according to task requirements. To this
end, a sliding manifold is introduced to achieve the sum of local gradients
approaching zero, based on which a distributed protocol is derived to reach a
consensus minimizing the global cost. A novel approach for convergence analysis
is derived in a unified settling time framework, resulting in an algorithm that
can precisely converge to the optimal solution at the prescribed time. The
method is interesting as it simply requires the primal states to be shared over
the network, which implies less communication requirements. The result is
extended to scenarios with time-varying objective function, by introducing
local gradients prediction and non-smooth consensus terms. Numerical
simulations are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms.

                                        <span>  Federated learning (FL) faces challenges of intermittent client availability
and computation/communication efficiency. As a result, only a small subset of
clients can participate in FL at a given time. It is important to understand
how partial client participation affects convergence, but most existing works
have either considered idealized participation patterns or obtained results
with non-zero optimality error for generic patterns. In this paper, we provide
a unified convergence analysis for FL with arbitrary client participation. We
first introduce a generalized version of federated averaging (FedAvg) that
amplifies parameter updates at an interval of multiple FL rounds. Then, we
present a novel analysis that captures the effect of client participation in a
single term. By analyzing this term, we obtain convergence upper bounds for a
wide range of participation patterns, including both non-stochastic and
stochastic cases, which match either the lower bound of stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) or the state-of-the-art results in specific settings. We also
discuss various insights, recommendations, and experimental results.

problems where a fictitious adversary, often envisioned as nature, can choose
the distribution of the uncertain problem parameters by reshaping a prescribed
reference distribution at a finite transportation cost. In this framework, we
show that robustification is intimately related to various forms of variation
and Lipschitz regularization even if the transportation cost function fails to
be (some power of) a metric. We also derive conditions for the existence and
the computability of a Nash equilibrium between the decision-maker and nature,
and we demonstrate numerically that nature's Nash strategy can be viewed as a
distribution that is supported on remarkably deceptive adversarial samples.
Finally, we identify practically relevant classes of optimal transport-based
distributionally robust optimization problems that can be addressed with
efficient gradient descent algorithms even if the loss function or the
transportation cost function are nonconvex (but not both at the same time).

                                        <span>  Adaptive gradient optimizers (AdaGrad), which dynamically adjust the learning
rate based on iterative gradients, have emerged as powerful tools in deep
learning. These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep
learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent. However, despite
AdaGrad's status as a cornerstone of adaptive optimization, its theoretical
analysis has not adequately addressed key aspects such as asymptotic
convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates in non-convex optimization
scenarios. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AdaGrad and
bridge the existing gaps in the literature. We introduce a new stopping time
technique from probability theory, which allows us to establish the stability
of AdaGrad under mild conditions. We further derive the asymptotically almost
sure and mean-square convergence for AdaGrad. In addition, we demonstrate the
near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared
gradients in expectation, which is stronger than the existing high-probability
results. The techniques developed in this work are potentially of independent
interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.

                                        <span>  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sophisticated perception systems to
interpret their surroundings, a cornerstone for safe navigation and
decision-making. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into AV
perception frameworks offers an innovative approach to address challenges in
dynamic environments, sensor fusion, and contextual reasoning. This paper
presents a novel framework for incorporating LLMs into AV perception, enabling
advanced contextual understanding, seamless sensor integration, and enhanced
decision support. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs significantly
improve the accuracy and reliability of AV perception systems, paving the way
for safer and more intelligent autonomous driving technologies. By expanding
the scope of perception beyond traditional methods, LLMs contribute to creating
a more adaptive and human-centric driving ecosystem, making autonomous vehicles
more reliable and transparent in their operations. These advancements redefine
the relationship between human drivers and autonomous systems, fostering trust
through enhanced understanding and personalized decision-making. Furthermore,
by integrating memory modules and adaptive learning mechanisms, LLMs introduce
continuous improvement in AV perception, enabling vehicles to evolve with time
and adapt to changing environments and user preferences.

                                        <span>  Learning to navigate in unstructured environments is a challenging task for
robots. While reinforcement learning can be effective, it often requires
extensive data collection and can pose risk. Learning from expert
demonstrations, on the other hand, offers a more efficient approach. However,
many existing methods rely on specific robot embodiments, pre-specified target
images and require large datasets. We propose the Visual Demonstration-based
Embodiment-agnostic Navigation (ViDEN) framework, a novel framework that
leverages visual demonstrations to train embodiment-agnostic navigation
policies. ViDEN utilizes depth images to reduce input dimensionality and relies
on relative target positions, making it more adaptable to diverse environments.
By training a diffusion-based policy on task-centric and embodiment-agnostic
demonstrations, ViDEN can generate collision-free and adaptive trajectories in
real-time. Our experiments on human reaching and tracking demonstrate that
ViDEN outperforms existing methods, requiring a small amount of data and
achieving superior performance in various indoor and outdoor navigation
scenarios. Project website: https://nimicurtis.github.io/ViDEN/.

in VR/AR and human animation. Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a
single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic
multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This
complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to
the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these
challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction
synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a
single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions.
To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition
scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize
the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both
data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit
synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with
various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over
existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.

terrain following/terrain avoidance, or dynamic obstacle avoidance for large
and medium-sized fixed-wing aircraft, fail to simultaneously meet the
requirements of real-time performance, long-distance planning, and the dynamic
constraints of large and medium-sized aircraft. To deal with this issue, this
paper proposes the Motion Dynamic RRT based Fluid Field - PPO for dynamic TF/TA
routing planning. Firstly, the action and state spaces of the proximal policy
gradient algorithm are redesigned using disturbance flow fields and artificial
potential field algorithms, establishing an aircraft dynamics model, and
designing a state transition process based on this model. Additionally, a
reward function is designed to encourage strategies for obstacle avoidance,
terrain following, terrain avoidance, and safe flight. Experimental results on
real DEM data demonstrate that our algorithm can complete long-distance flight
tasks through collision-free trajectory planning that complies with dynamic
constraints, without the need for prior global planning.

Reinforcement Learning (D-MARL) exploration by proposing communication-induced
action space to improve the mapping efficiency of unknown environments using
homogeneous agents. Efficient exploration of large environments relies heavily
on inter-agent communication as real-world scenarios are often constrained by
data transmission limits, such as signal latency and bandwidth. Our proposed
method optimizes each agent's policy using the heterogeneous-agent proximal
policy optimization algorithm, allowing agents to autonomously decide whether
to communicate or to explore, that is whether to share the locally collected
maps or continue the exploration. We propose and compare multiple novel reward
functions that integrate inter-agent communication and exploration, enhance
mapping efficiency and robustness, and minimize exploration overlap. This
article presents a framework developed in ROS2 to evaluate and validate the
investigated architecture. Specifically, four TurtleBot3 Burgers have been
deployed in a Gazebo-designed environment filled with obstacles to evaluate the
efficacy of the trained policies in mapping the exploration arena.

search and rescue operations. Effective real-world deployment must address
challenges such as limited inter-agent communication and static and dynamic
obstacles. This paper introduces a novel decentralized collaborative framework
based on Reinforcement Learning to enhance multi-agent exploration in unknown
environments. Our approach enables agents to decide their next action using an
agent-centered field-of-view occupancy grid, and features extracted from
$\text{A}^*$ algorithm-based trajectories to frontiers in the reconstructed
global map. Furthermore, we propose a constrained communication scheme that
enables agents to share their environmental knowledge efficiently, minimizing
exploration redundancy. The decentralized nature of our framework ensures that
each agent operates autonomously, while contributing to a collective
exploration mission. Extensive simulations in Gymnasium and real-world
experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our system, while
all the results highlight the benefits of combining autonomous exploration with
inter-agent map sharing, advancing the development of scalable and resilient
robotic exploration systems.

autonomous system. In this work, we use the Recursive Gaussian Processes (RGP)
for identification of the quadrotor air drag model online, without the need of
training data. The identified drag model then augments a physics-based model of
the quadrotor dynamics, which allows more accurate quadrotor state prediction
with increased ability to adapt to changing conditions. This data-augmented
physics-based model is utilized for precise quadrotor trajectory tracking using
the suitably modified Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The proposed
modelling and control approach is evaluated using the Gazebo simulator and it
is shown that the proposed approach tracks a desired trajectory with a higher
accuracy compared to the MPC with the non-augmented (purely physics-based)
model.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel approach to improve global localization and
mapping in indoor drone navigation by integrating 5G Time of Arrival (ToA)
measurements into ORB-SLAM3, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
system. By incorporating ToA data from 5G base stations, we align the SLAM's
local reference frame with a global coordinate system, enabling accurate and
consistent global localization. We extend ORB-SLAM3's optimization pipeline to
integrate ToA measurements alongside bias estimation, transforming the
inherently local estimation into a globally consistent one. This integration
effectively resolves scale ambiguity in monocular SLAM systems and enhances
robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios where standard SLAM may fail.
Our method is evaluated using five real-world indoor datasets collected with
RGB-D cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs), augmented with simulated
5G ToA measurements at 28 GHz and 78 GHz frequencies using MATLAB and QuaDRiGa.
We tested four SLAM configurations: RGB-D, RGB-D-Inertial, Monocular, and
Monocular-Inertial. The results demonstrate that while local estimation
accuracy remains comparable due to the high precision of RGB-D-based ORB-SLAM3
compared to ToA measurements, the inclusion of ToA measurements facilitates
robust global positioning. In scenarios where standard mono-inertial ORB-SLAM3
loses tracking, our approach maintains accurate localization throughout the
trajectory.

                                        <span>  In hazardous environments like nuclear facilities, robotic systems are
essential for executing tasks that would otherwise expose humans to dangerous
radiation levels, which pose severe health risks and can be fatal. However,
many operations in the nuclear environment require teleoperating robots,
resulting in a significant cognitive load on operators as well as physical
strain over extended periods of time. To address this challenge, we propose
enhancing the teleoperation system with an assistive model capable of
predicting operator intentions and dynamically adapting to their needs. The
machine learning model processes robotic arm force data, analyzing
spatiotemporal patterns to accurately detect the ongoing task before its
completion. To support this approach, we collected a diverse dataset from
teleoperation experiments involving glovebox tasks in nuclear applications.
This dataset encompasses heterogeneous spatiotemporal data captured from the
teleoperation system. We employ a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to learn and forecast operator intentions
based on the spatiotemporal data. By accurately predicting these intentions,
the robot can execute tasks more efficiently and effectively, requiring minimal
input from the operator. Our experiments validated the model using the dataset,
focusing on tasks such as radiation surveys and object grasping. The proposed
approach demonstrated an F1-score of 89% for task classification and an
F1-score of 86% classification forecasted operator intentions over a 5-second
window. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve the
safety, precision, and efficiency of robotic operations in hazardous
environments, thereby significantly reducing human radiation exposure.

communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical
resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency
(VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation,
fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded
platforms focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance
evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a
remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests
demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances
beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that
the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as
turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- that generally affect
acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete
submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations.
This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas
outside the laboratory, and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date.
BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in
multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.

                                        <span>  We introduce a novel approach for manipulating articulated objects which are
visually ambiguous, such doors which are symmetric or which are heavily
occluded. These ambiguities can cause uncertainty over different possible
articulation modes: for instance, when the articulation direction (e.g. push,
pull, slide) or location (e.g. left side, right side) of a fully closed door
are uncertain, or when distinguishing features like the plane of the door are
occluded due to the viewing angle. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
history-aware diffusion network that can model multi-modal distributions over
articulation modes for articulated objects; our method further uses observation
history to distinguish between modes and make stable predictions under
occlusions. Experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-art performance on articulated object manipulation and dramatically
improves performance for articulated objects containing visual ambiguities. Our

(6 DOFs), moving amidst polyhedral obstacles. A correct, complete and practical
path planner for such a robot has never been achieved, although this is widely
recognized as a key challenge in robotics. This paper provides a complete
"explicit" design, down to explicit geometric primitives that are easily
implementable.
  Our design is within an algorithmic framework for path planners, called Soft
Subdivision Search (SSS). The framework is based on the twin foundations of
$\epsilon$-exactness and soft predicates, which are critical for rigorous
numerical implementations. The practicality of SSS has been previously
demonstrated for various robots including 5-DOF spatial robots.
  In this paper, we solve several significant technical challenges for SE(3)
robots: (1) We first ensure the correct theory by proving a general form of the
Fundamental Theorem of the SSS theory. We prove this within an axiomatic
framework, thus making it easy for future applications of this theory. (2) One
component of $SE(3) = R^3 \times SO(3)$ is the non-Euclidean space SO(3). We
design a novel topologically correct data structure for SO(3). Using the
concept of subdivision charts and atlases for SO(3), we can now carry out
subdivision of SO(3). (3) The geometric problem of collision detection takes
place in $R^3$, via the footprint map. Unlike sampling-based approaches, we
must reason with the notion of footprints of configuration boxes, which is much
harder to characterize. Exploiting the theory of soft predicates, we design
suitable approximate footprints which, when combined with the highly effective
feature-set technique, lead to soft predicates. (4) Finally, we make the
underlying geometric computation "explicit", i.e., avoiding a general solver of
polynomial systems, in order to allow a direct implementation.

necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system
identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in
linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or
positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property
called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system
trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed
loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming
nonlinearities are lipschitz bounded in subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We extend
the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key
to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop
contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional
membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its
potential for robust data-driven contraction.

guarantees of uniform almost global asymptotic stability for the state tracking
error dynamics of a quadcopter. The proposed approach features a model
predictive control strategy for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for the
non-zero total thrust constraint. The outer-loop controller generates an
acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude, angular velocity
and acceleration references, subsequently tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop
controller. The proposed cascade control strategy is validated through
numerical case studies, underlying high-fidelity models, demonstrating its
ability to track fast trajectories with small error.

in decision-making. The opinions of the individuals evolve using the
Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model. We consider that there are two competing
`influencers' (stubborn agents) vying for control over the final opinion of the
group. We investigate the impact of modifying the network interactions on their
respective control over the final opinions (influence centrality). We use
signal flow graphs (SFG) to relate the network interactions with the influence
that each `influencer' exerts on others. We present the sufficient conditions
on the edge modifications which lead to the increase of the influence of an
`influencer' at the expense of the other. Interestingly, the analysis also
reveals the existence of redundant edge modifications that result in no change
in the influence centrality of the network. We present several numerical
examples to illustrate these results.

                                        <span>  Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their
low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although
distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions
through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This
paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and
temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total
cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints.
Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time
strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient
temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring
prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the
optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is
proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while
ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate
the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.

global search problem that aims to provide a set of solutions that are of high
quality and diverse. In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the
original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and
the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate
the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional
probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of
attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is
learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction
of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked
on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular
restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple
multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also
provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a
low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.

                                        <span>  Digital twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach to
simulate, predict, and optimize the behavior of physical systems, with
applications that span manufacturing, healthcare, climate science, and more.
However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data
requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic
changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by
dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic
data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines
the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the
physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical
behaviors. We apply DDD-GenDT to the computer numerical control (CNC) machining
process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling
wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior
from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental
results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can
adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction
is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of
10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we
analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their
potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and
challenges that may arise in practical implementations.

autonomous system. In this work, we use the Recursive Gaussian Processes (RGP)
for identification of the quadrotor air drag model online, without the need of
training data. The identified drag model then augments a physics-based model of
the quadrotor dynamics, which allows more accurate quadrotor state prediction
with increased ability to adapt to changing conditions. This data-augmented
physics-based model is utilized for precise quadrotor trajectory tracking using
the suitably modified Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The proposed
modelling and control approach is evaluated using the Gazebo simulator and it
is shown that the proposed approach tracks a desired trajectory with a higher
accuracy compared to the MPC with the non-augmented (purely physics-based)
model.

problem for a class of pure-feedback system with full-state constraints. With
the help of Mean-Value Theorem, the pure-feedback nonlinear system is
transformed into strict-feedback case. By employing finite-time-stable like
function and state transformation for output tracking error, the output
tracking error converges to a predefined set in a fixed finite interval. To
tackle the problem of state constraints, integral Barrier Lyapunov functions
are utilized to guarantee that the state variables remain within the prescribed
constraints with feasibility check. Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to
approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. In addition, all the signals in
the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be semi-global ultimately uniformly
bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness
of the proposed control strategy.

                                        <span>  This paper studies a decentralized homogeneous multi-armed bandit problem in
a multi-agent network. The problem is simultaneously solved by $N$ agents
assuming they face a common set of $M$ arms and share the same arms' reward
distributions. Each agent can receive information only from its neighbors,
where the neighbor relationships among the agents are described by a fixed
graph. Two fully decentralized upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms are
proposed for undirected graphs, respectively based on the classic algorithm and
the state-of-the-art Kullback-Leibler upper confidence bound (KL-UCB)
algorithm. The proposed decentralized UCB1 and KL-UCB algorithms permit each
agent in the network to achieve a better logarithmic asymptotic regret than
their single-agent counterparts, provided that the agent has at least one
neighbor, and the more neighbors an agent has, the better regret it will have,
meaning that the sum is more than its component parts. The same algorithm
design framework is also extended to directed graphs through the design of a
variant of the decentralized UCB1 algorithm, which outperforms the single-agent
UCB1 algorithm.

                                        <span>  This brief constructs the adaptive backstepping control scheme for a class of
pure-feedback systems with input delay and full state constraints. With the
help of Mean Value Theorem, the pure-feedback system is transformed into
strict-feedback one. Barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to guarantee all
of the states remain constrained within predefined sets. By introducing the
Pade approximation method and corresponding intermediate, the impact generated
by input delay on the output tracking performance of the system can be
eliminated. Furthermore, a low-pass filter driven by a newly-defined control
input, is employed to generate the actual control input, which facilitates the
design of backstepping control. To approximate the unknown functions with a
desired level of accuracy, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized by
choosing appropriate fuzzy rules, logics and so on. The minimal learning
parameter (MLP) technique is employed to decrease the number of nodes and
parameters in FLSs, and dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is leveraged to
avoid so-called "explosion of complexity". Moreover, smooth robust compensators
are introduced to circumvent the influences of external disturbance and
approximation errors. By stability analysis, it is proved that all of signals
in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately uniform bounded, and the
tracking error can be within a arbitrary small neighbor of origin via selecting
appropriate parameters of controllers. Finally, the results of numerical
illustration are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed
method.

                                        <span>  The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection
necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system
identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in
linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or
positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property
called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system
trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed
loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming
nonlinearities are lipschitz bounded in subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We extend
the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key
to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop
contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional
membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its
potential for robust data-driven contraction.

                                        <span>  Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridges (GSBs) are a fundamental mathematical
framework used to analyze the most likely particle evolution based on the
principle of least action including kinetic and potential energy. In parallel
to their well-established presence in the theoretical realms of quantum
mechanics and optimal transport, this paper focuses on an algorithmic
perspective, aiming to enhance practical usage. Our motivated observation is
that transportation problems with the optimality structures delineated by GSBs
are pervasive across various scientific domains, such as generative modeling in
machine learning, mean-field games in stochastic control, and more. Exploring
the intrinsic connection between the mathematical modeling of GSBs and the
modern algorithmic characterization therefore presents a crucial, yet untapped,
avenue. In this paper, we reinterpret GSBs as probabilistic models and
demonstrate that, with a delicate mathematical tool known as the nonlinear
Feynman-Kac lemma, rich algorithmic concepts, such as likelihoods, variational
gaps, and temporal differences, emerge naturally from the optimality structures
of GSBs. The resulting computational framework, driven by deep learning and
neural networks, operates in a fully continuous state space (i.e., mesh-free)
and satisfies distribution constraints, setting it apart from prior numerical
solvers relying on spatial discretization or constraint relaxation. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generative modeling and mean-field
games, highlighting its transformative applications at the intersection of
mathematical modeling, stochastic process, control, and machine learning.

predictive control strategy for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for the

acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude, angular velocity
and acceleration references, subsequently tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop
controller. The proposed cascade control strategy is validated through
numerical case studies, underlying high-fidelity models, demonstrating its
ability to track fast trajectories with small error.

applications to sampling and optimization in constrained domains by considering
reflected mean-field Langevin SDEs and two reflected consensus-based

study long-time behaviour of reflected mean-field SDEs and also investigate
convergence of the reflected CBO models to the global minimum of a constrained
optimization problem. We numerically test reflected CBO models on benchmark
constrained optimization problems and an inverse problem.

                                        <span>  The long-run behavior of multi-agent learning - and, in particular, no-regret
learning - is relatively well-understood in potential games, where players have
aligned interests. By contrast, in harmonic games - the strategic counterpart
of potential games, where players have conflicting interests - very little is
known outside the narrow subclass of 2-player zero-sum games with a fully-mixed
equilibrium. Our paper seeks to partially fill this gap by focusing on the full
class of (generalized) harmonic games and examining the convergence properties
of follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL), the most widely studied class of
no-regret learning schemes. As a first result, we show that the continuous-time
dynamics of FTRL are Poincar\'e recurrent, that is, they return arbitrarily
close to their starting point infinitely often, and hence fail to converge. In
discrete time, the standard, "vanilla" implementation of FTRL may lead to even
worse outcomes, eventually trapping the players in a perpetual cycle of
best-responses. However, if FTRL is augmented with a suitable extrapolation
step - which includes as special cases the optimistic and mirror-prox variants
of FTRL - we show that learning converges to a Nash equilibrium from any
initial condition, and all players are guaranteed at most O(1) regret. These
results provide an in-depth understanding of no-regret learning in harmonic
games, nesting prior work on 2-player zero-sum games, and showing at a high
level that harmonic games are the canonical complement of potential games, not
only from a strategic, but also from a dynamic viewpoint.

weakly minimal points of set-valued optimization problems under a lower set
less ordering relation. The set-valued objective function of the optimization
problem under consideration is defined by finitely many continuously
differentiable vector-valued functions. For such optimization problems, at
first, we propose a general scheme for nonlinear conjugate gradient methods and
then introduce Dai-Yuan, Polak-Ribi{\`e}re-Polyak, and Hestenes-Stiefel
conjugate gradient parameters for set-valued functions. Toward deriving the
general scheme, we introduce a condition of sufficient decrease and Wolfe line
searches for set-valued functions. For a given sequence of descent directions
of a set-valued function, it is found that if the proposed standard Wolfe line
search technique is employed, then the generated sequence of iterates for set
optimization follows a Zoutendijk-like condition. With the help of the derived
Zoutendijk-like condition, we report that all the proposed nonlinear conjugate
gradient schemes are globally convergent under usual assumptions. It is
important to note that the ordering cone used in the entire study is not
restricted to be finitely generated, and no regularity assumption on the
solution set of the problem is required for any of the reported convergence
analyses. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods
through numerical experiments. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods not only on the commonly used test
instances for set optimization but also on a few newly introduced problems
under general ordering cones that are neither nonnegative hyper-octant nor
finitely generated.

                                        <span>  Interior point methods for solving linearly constrained convex programming
involve a variable projection matrix at each iteration to deal with the linear
constraints. This matrix often becomes ill-conditioned near the boundary of the
feasible region that results in wrong search directions and extra computational
cost. A matrix-free interior point augmented Lagrangian continuous trajectory
is therefore proposed and studied for linearly constrained convex programming.
A closely related ordinary differential equation (ODE) system is formulated. In
this ODE system, the variable projection matrix is no longer needed. By only
assuming the existence of an optimal solution, we show that, starting from any
interior feasible point, (i) the interior point augmented Lagrangian continuous
trajectory is convergent; and (ii) the limit point is indeed an optimal
solution of the original optimization problem. Moreover, with the addition of
the strictly complementarity condition, we show that the associated Lagrange
multiplier converges to an optimal solution of the Lagrangian dual problem.
Based on the studied ODE system, several possible search directions for
discrete algorithms are proposed and discussed.

                                        <span>  Regularization is a widely recognized technique in mathematical optimization.
It can be used to smooth out objective functions, refine the feasible solution
set, or prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Due to its simplicity
and robustness, the gradient descent (GD) method is one of the primary methods
used for numerical optimization of differentiable objective functions. However,
GD is not well-suited for solving $\ell^1$ regularized optimization problems
since these problems are non-differentiable at zero, causing iteration updates
to oscillate or fail to converge. Instead, a more effective version of GD,
called the proximal gradient descent employs a technique known as
soft-thresholding to shrink the iteration updates toward zero, thus enabling
sparsity in the solution. Motivated by the widespread applications of proximal
GD in sparse and low-rank recovery across various engineering disciplines, we
provide an overview of the GD and proximal GD methods for solving regularized
optimization problems. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for
the proximal GD method that incorporates a variable step size. Unlike
conventional proximal GD, which uses a fixed step size based on the global
Lipschitz constant, our method estimates the Lipschitz constant locally at each
iteration and uses its reciprocal as the step size. This eliminates the need
for a global Lipschitz constant, which can be impractical to compute. Numerical
experiments we performed on synthetic and real-data sets show notable
performance improvement of the proposed method compared to the conventional
proximal GD with constant step size, both in terms of number of iterations and
in time requirements.

location problems whose main goal is to locate a given number of services and
entry points in each region to distribute certain products to the users at
minimum transportation cost. Additionally, a minimum satisfaction level is
required for the customers in each region. This satisfaction is measured
through continuous preference functions that reflect the satisfaction degree of
each location in the region. We provide a mathematical optimization-based
framework for the problem and derive suitable Mixed Integer Second Order Cone
optimization models for some interesting situations: norm-based transportation
costs for the services to the entry points, and different families of
preference functions. Among these preference functions, we highlight those
derived from economic production models and distance-based preferences. We
conduct an extensive computational study along two main lines: a computational

the single-facility case and up to $50$ for the p-facility case; and a
qualitative approach, where we analyze whether the incorporation of preferences
is statistically significant compared to the case without preferences.

                                        <span>  Preliminary spacecraft trajectory optimization is a parameter dependent
global search problem that aims to provide a set of solutions that are of high
quality and diverse. In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the
original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and
the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate
the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional
probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of
attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is
learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction
of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked
on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular
restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple
multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also
provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a
low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.

                                        <span>  This paper studies the problem of stochastic bilevel optimization where the
upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the
lower-level function is strongly convex. This problem is motivated by
meta-learning applied to sequential data, such as text classification using
recurrent neural networks, where the smoothness constant of the upper-level
loss function scales linearly with the gradient norm and can be potentially
unbounded. Existing algorithm crucially relies on the nested loop design, which
requires significant tuning efforts and is not practical. In this paper, we
address this issue by proposing a Single Loop bIlevel oPtimizer (SLIP). The
proposed algorithm first updates the lower-level variable by a few steps of
stochastic gradient descent, and then simultaneously updates the upper-level
variable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with momentum and the
lower-level variable by stochastic gradient descent. Under standard
assumptions, we show that our algorithm finds an $\epsilon$-stationary point
within $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$\footnote{Here $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$
compresses logarithmic factors of $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\delta$, where
$\delta\in(0,1)$ denotes the failure probability.} oracle calls of stochastic
gradient or Hessian-vector product, both in expectation and with high
probability. This complexity result is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors
without mean-square smoothness of the stochastic gradient oracle. Our proof
relies on (i) a refined characterization and control of the lower-level
variable and (ii) establishing a novel connection between bilevel optimization
and stochastic optimization under distributional drift. Our experiments on
various tasks show that our algorithm significantly outperforms strong
baselines in bilevel optimization.

the expectation-formulated generalized Stiefel manifold (SOEGS), where the
objective function $f$ is continuously differentiable. We propose a novel
constraint dissolving penalty function with a customized penalty term (CDFDP),
which maintains the same order of differentiability as $f$. Our theoretical
analysis establishes the global equivalence between CDFCP and SOEGS in the
sense that they share the same first-order and second-order stationary points
under mild conditions. These results on equivalence enable the direct
implementation of various stochastic optimization approaches to solve SOEGS. In
particular, we develop a stochastic gradient algorithm and its accelerated
variant by incorporating an adaptive step size strategy. Furthermore, we prove
their $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity for finding an
$\varepsilon$-stationary point of CDFCP. Comprehensive numerical experiments
show the efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithms.

and intepretable neural fields, but also introduce biases that are not
necessarily beneficial for real-world data. In this work, we (1) characterize
the undesirable biases that these architectures have for axis-aligned signals
-- they can lead to radiance field reconstruction differences of as high as 2
PSNR -- and (2) explore how learning a set of canonicalizing transformations
can improve representations by removing these biases. We prove in a
two-dimensional model problem that simultaneously learning these
transformations together with scene appearance succeeds with drastically
improved efficiency. We validate the resulting architectures, which we call
TILTED, using image, signed distance, and radiance field reconstruction tasks,
where we observe improvements across quality, robustness, compactness, and
runtime. Results demonstrate that TILTED can enable capabilities comparable to
baselines that are 2x larger, while highlighting weaknesses of neural field
evaluation procedures.

traditional applications to become integral in diverse sectors, including
supply chain management. This research develops a robust network flow model for
semiconductor wafer supply chains, optimizing resource allocation and
addressing maximum flow challenges in production and logistics. The model
incorporates the stochastic nature of wafer batch transfers and employs a
dual-layer optimization framework to reduce variability and exceedance
probabilities in finished goods. Empirical comparisons reveal significant
enhancements in cost efficiency, productivity, and resource utilization, with a
20% reduction in time and production costs, and a 10% increase in
transportation and storage capacities. The model's efficacy is underscored by a
15% decrease in transportation time and a 6700 kg increase in total capacity,
demonstrating its capability to resolve logistical bottlenecks in semiconductor
manufacturing. This study concludes that network flow models are a potent tool
for optimizing supply chain logistics, offering a 23% improvement in resource
utilization and a 13% boost in accuracy. The findings provide valuable insights
for supply chain logistics optimization.

optimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture
search, and meta-learning. A common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize
a hyper-objective that implicitly depends on the solution set of the
lower-level function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely used,
its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases where
the lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we first provide
hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary points of the
hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be intractable
for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable
nonconvex-nonconvex bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies
the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order
algorithm can achieve better complexity bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ in the deterministic, partially
stochastic, and fully stochastic setting respectively.

                                        <span>  Online linear programming (OLP) has gained significant attention from both
researchers and practitioners due to its extensive applications, such as online
auction, network revenue management, order fulfillment and advertising.
Existing OLP algorithms fall into two categories: LP-based algorithms and
LP-free algorithms. The former one typically guarantees better performance,
even offering a constant regret, but requires solving a large number of LPs,
which could be computationally expensive. In contrast, LP-free algorithm only
requires first-order computations but induces a worse performance, lacking a
constant regret bound. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two
extremes by proposing a well-performing algorithm, that solves LPs at a few
selected time points and conducts first-order computations at other time
points. Specifically, for the case where the inputs are drawn from an unknown
finite-support distribution, the proposed algorithm achieves a constant regret
(even for the hard ``degenerate'' case) while solving LPs only
$\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$ times over the time horizon $T$. Moreover, when we
are allowed to solve LPs only $M$ times, we design the corresponding schedule
such that the proposed algorithm can guarantee a nearly
$\mathcal{O}\left(T^{(1/2)^{M-1}}\right)$ regret. Our work highlights the value
of resolving both at the beginning and the end of the selling horizon, and
provides a novel framework to prove the performance guarantee of the proposed
policy under different infrequent resolving schedules. Furthermore, when the
arrival probabilities are known at the beginning, our algorithm can guarantee a
constant regret by solving LPs $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$ times, and a nearly
$\mathcal{O}\left(T^{(1/2)^{M}}\right)$ regret by solving LPs only $M$ times.
Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed algorithms.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a generalization of the well-known Riccati recursion
for solving the discrete-time equality-constrained linear quadratic optimal
control problem. The recursion can be used to compute the solutions as well as
optimal feedback control policies. Unlike other tailored approaches for this
problem class, the proposed method does not require restrictive regularity
conditions on the problem. This allows its use in nonlinear optimal control
problem solvers that use exact Lagrangian Hessian information. We demonstrate
that our approach can be implemented in a highly efficient algorithm that
scales linearly with the horizon length. Numerical tests show a significant
speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude with respect to state-of-the-art
general-purpose sparse linear solvers. Based on the proposed approach, faster
nonlinear optimal control problem solvers can be developed that are suitable
for more complex applications or for implementations on low-cost or low-power
computational platforms. The implementation of the proposed algorithm is made
available as open-source software.

                                        <span>  Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and
minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear
process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This
study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear
prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process,
relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits
generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often
impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this
research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal
training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple
setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation
approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via
transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models,
including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks
(LSTM), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, trained on different
input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT).
The performance of the models is evaluated on different amounts of training
data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing
insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results
demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective
tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and
efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt
model has an exceptional performance, achieving an 99.1% accuracy in
identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until
they are worn.

                                        <span>  The performance of optimization-based robot motion planning algorithms is
highly dependent on the initial solutions, commonly obtained by running a
sampling-based planner to obtain a collision-free path. However, these methods
can be slow in high-dimensional and complex scenes and produce non-smooth
solutions. Given previously solved path-planning problems, it is highly
desirable to learn their distribution and use it as a prior for new similar
problems. Several works propose utilizing this prior to bootstrap the motion
planning problem, either by sampling initial solutions from it, or using its
distribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory optimization.
In this work, we introduce Motion Planning Diffusion (MPD), an algorithm that
learns trajectory distribution priors with diffusion models. These generative
models have shown increasing success in encoding multimodal data and have
desirable properties for gradient-based motion planning, such as cost guidance.
Given a motion planning problem, we construct a cost function and sample from
the posterior distribution using the learned prior combined with the cost
function gradients during the denoising process. Instead of learning the prior
on all trajectory waypoints, we propose learning a lower-dimensional
representation of a trajectory using linear motion primitives, particularly
B-spline curves. This parametrization guarantees that the generated trajectory
is smooth, can be interpolated at higher frequencies, and needs fewer
parameters than a dense waypoint representation. We demonstrate the results of
our method ranging from simple 2D to more complex tasks using a 7-dof robot arm
manipulator. In addition to learning from simulated data, we also use human
demonstrations on a real-world pick-and-place task.

robots -- particularly multi-robot systems and swarms. Previous efforts have
primarily focussed on spontaneously occurring electro-mechanical failures in
the sensors and actuators of a minority sub-population of robots. While the
systems that enable this function are valuable, they have not yet considered
that many failures arise from gradual wear and tear with continued operation,
and that this may be more challenging to detect than sudden step changes in
performance. This paper presents the Artificial Antibody Population Dynamics
(AAPD) model -- an immune-inspired model for the detection and diagnosis of
gradual degradation in robot swarms. The AAPD model is demonstrated to reliably
detect and diagnose gradual degradation, as well as spontaneous changes in
performance, among swarms of robots of as few as 5 robots while remaining
tolerant of normally behaving robots. The AAPD model is distributed, offers
supervised and unsupervised configurations, and demonstrates promising scalable
properties. Deploying the AAPD model on a swarm of foraging robots undergoing
slow degradation enables the swarm to operate at an average of ~79\% of its
performance in perfect conditions.

                                        <span>  This work demonstrates universal dynamic perching capabilities for quadrotors
of various sizes and on surfaces with different orientations. By employing a
non-dimensionalization framework and deep reinforcement learning, we
systematically assessed how robot size and surface orientation affect landing
capabilities. We hypothesized that maintaining geometric proportions across
different robot scales ensures consistent perching behavior, which was
validated in both simulation and experimental tests. Additionally, we
investigated the effects of joint stiffness and damping in the landing gear on
perching behaviors and performance. While joint stiffness had minimal impact,
joint damping ratios influenced landing success under vertical approaching
conditions. The study also identified a critical velocity threshold necessary
for successful perching, determined by the robot's maneuverability and leg
geometry. Overall, this research advances robotic perching capabilities,
offering insights into the role of mechanical design and scaling effects, and
lays the groundwork for future drone autonomy and operational efficiency in
unstructured environments.

                                        <span>  Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is promising in achieving optimal
cooperative control in multirobot systems (MRS). However, real-time DMPC
implementation relies on numerical optimization tools to periodically calculate
local control sequences online. This process is computationally demanding and
lacks scalability for large-scale, nonlinear MRS. This article proposes a novel
distributed learning-based predictive control (DLPC) framework for scalable
multirobot control. Unlike conventional DMPC methods that calculate open-loop
control sequences, our approach centers around a computationally fast and
efficient distributed policy learning algorithm that generates explicit
closed-loop DMPC policies for MRS without using numerical solvers. The policy
learning is executed incrementally and forward in time in each prediction
interval through an online distributed actor-critic implementation. The control
policies are successively updated in a receding-horizon manner, enabling fast
and efficient policy learning with the closed-loop stability guarantee. The
learned control policies could be deployed online to MRS with varying robot
scales, enhancing scalability and transferability for large-scale MRS.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to address the multirobot safe learning
challenge through a force field-inspired policy learning approach. We validate
our approach's effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency through extensive
experiments on cooperative tasks of large-scale wheeled robots and multirotor
drones. Our results demonstrate the rapid learning and deployment of DMPC
policies for MRS with scales up to 10,000 units.

                                        <span>  Current social navigation methods and benchmarks primarily focus on proxemics
and task efficiency. While these factors are important, qualitative aspects
such as perceptions of a robot's social competence are equally crucial for
successful adoption and integration into human environments. We propose a more
comprehensive evaluation of social navigation through scenario-based testing,
where specific human-robot interaction scenarios can reveal key robot
behaviors. However, creating such scenarios is often labor-intensive and
complex. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a pipeline that
automates the generation of context-, and location-appropriate social
navigation scenarios, ready for simulation. Our pipeline transforms simple
scenario metadata into detailed textual scenarios, infers pedestrian and robot
trajectories, and simulates pedestrian behaviors, which enables more controlled
evaluation. We leverage the social reasoning and code-generation capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline scenario generation and
translation. Our experiments show that our pipeline produces realistic
scenarios and significantly improves scenario translation over naive LLM
prompting. Additionally, we present initial feedback from a usability study
with social navigation experts and a case-study demonstrating a scenario-based
evaluation of three navigation algorithms.

actionable hierarchical scene graph, fully integrated with a multi-modal
mission planner, the FLIE: A First-Look based Inspection and Exploration
planner. The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of
maintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while
simultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene
understanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown
targets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is
composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of
abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the
integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic
segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic
elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of
the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed
decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the
hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which can extend
inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in
an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through
extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as
experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in
urban outdoor environment settings.

construction and real-time exploitation by a multi-modal autonomy, First-Look

contributions, the proposed architecture aims to provide a high-level
multi-tiered abstract environment representation whilst simultaneously

capable of enhancing inspection planning through scene understanding, what

                                        <span>  Planning safe paths in 3D workspace for high DoF robotic systems, such as
manipulators, is a challenging problem, especially when the environment is
populated with the dynamic obstacles that need to be avoided. In this case the
time dimension should be taken into account that further increases the
complexity of planning. To mitigate this issue we suggest to combine
safe-interval path planning (a prominent technique in heuristic search) with
the randomized planning, specifically, with the bidirectional rapidly-exploring
random trees (RRT-Connect) - a fast and efficient algorithm for
high-dimensional planning. Leveraging a dedicated technique of fast computation
of the safe intervals we end up with an efficient planner dubbed SI-RRT. We
compare it with the state of the art and show that SI-RRT consistently
outperforms the competitors both in runtime and solution cost.
  Our implementation of SI-RRT is publicly available at

                                        <span>  This work focuses on building a task planner for Embodied Instruction
Following (EIF) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works typically
train a planner to imitate expert trajectories, treating this as a supervised
task. While these methods achieve competitive performance, they often lack
sufficient robustness. When a suboptimal action is taken, the planner may
encounter an out-of-distribution state, which can lead to task failure. In
contrast, we frame the task as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(POMDP) and aim to develop a robust planner under a few-shot assumption. Thus,
we propose a closed-loop planner with an adaptation module and a novel
hindsight method, aiming to use as much information as possible to assist the
planner. Our experiments on the ALFRED dataset indicate that our planner
achieves competitive performance under a few-shot assumption. For the first
time, our few-shot agent's performance approaches and even surpasses that of
the full-shot supervised agent.

                                        <span>  To improve the efficiency of warehousing system and meet huge customer
orders, we aim to solve the challenges of dimension disaster and dynamic
properties in hyper scale multi-robot task planning (MRTP) for robotic mobile
fulfillment system (RMFS). Existing research indicates that hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) is an effective method to reduce these challenges.
Based on that, we construct an efficient multi-stage HRL-based multi-robot task
planner for hyper scale MRTP in RMFS, and the planning process is represented
with a special temporal graph topology. To ensure optimality, the planner is
designed with a centralized architecture, but it also brings the challenges of
scaling up and generalization that require policies to maintain performance for
various unlearned scales and maps. To tackle these difficulties, we first
construct a hierarchical temporal attention network (HTAN) to ensure basic
ability of handling inputs with unfixed lengths, and then design multi-stage
curricula for hierarchical policy learning to further improve the scaling up
and generalization ability while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Additionally, we notice that policies with hierarchical structure suffer from
unfair credit assignment that is similar to that in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, inspired of which, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning
algorithm with counterfactual rollout baseline to improve learning performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that our planner outperform other
state-of-the-art methods on various MRTP instances in both simulated and
real-world RMFS. Also, our planner can successfully scale up to hyper scale
MRTP instances in RMFS with up to 200 robots and 1000 retrieval racks on
unlearned maps while keeping superior performance over other methods.

                                        <span>  Redundant manipulators, with their higher Degrees of Freedom (DOFs), offer
enhanced kinematic performance and versatility, making them suitable for
applications like manufacturing, surgical robotics, and human-robot
collaboration. However, motion planning for these manipulators is challenging
due to increased DOFs and complex, dynamic environments. While traditional
motion planning algorithms struggle with high-dimensional spaces, deep
learning-based methods often face instability and inefficiency in complex
tasks. This paper introduces RobotDiffuse, a diffusion model-based approach for
motion planning in redundant manipulators. By integrating physical constraints
with a point cloud encoder and replacing the U-Net structure with an
encoder-only transformer, RobotDiffuse improves the model's ability to capture
temporal dependencies and generate smoother, more coherent motion plans. We
validate the approach using a complex simulator, and release a new dataset with
35M robot poses and 0.14M obstacle avoidance scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of RobotDiffuse and the promise of diffusion
models for motion planning tasks. The code can be accessed at

The primary contributions of this work are (1) the development of a novel
objective function for level set estimation that utilizes a rigorous assessment
of uncertainty, and (2) a description of the practical challenges and
corresponding solutions needed to implement our approach in the field using a
team of AUVs. We combine path planning techniques and an approach to
decentralization from prior work that yields theoretical performance
guarantees. Experimentation with a team of AUVs provides empirical evidence
that the desirable performance guarantees can be preserved in practice even in
the presence of limitations that commonly arise in underwater robotics,
including slow and intermittent acoustic communications and limited
computational resources.

key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce
defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as
the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the
greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric
maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time
localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping
pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network
of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting
layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation
of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point
(ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion
profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals
that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA)
LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences
where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used,
without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16
and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than
250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both
indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional
configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps. The framework
is open-sourced online: https://github.com/MOLAorg/mola

applications where the robot needs to be positioned precisely relative to an
object for downstream tasks, such as docking, inspection, and manipulation. To
this end, we design and implement Aim-My-Robot (AMR), a local navigation system
that enables a robot to reach any object in its vicinity at the desired
relative pose, with centimeter-level precision. AMR achieves high precision and
robustness by leveraging multi-modal perception, precise action prediction, and
is trained on large-scale photorealistic data generated in simulation. AMR
shows strong sim2real transfer and can adapt to different robot kinematics and
unseen objects with little to no fine-tuning.

                                        <span>  Developing robots that can assist humans efficiently, safely, and adaptively
is crucial for real-world applications such as healthcare. While previous work
often assumes a centralized system for co-optimizing human-robot interactions,
we argue that real-world scenarios are much more complicated, as humans have
individual preferences regarding how tasks are performed. Robots typically lack
direct access to these implicit preferences. However, to provide effective
assistance, robots must still be able to recognize and adapt to the individual
needs and preferences of different users. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework in which robots infer human intentions and reason
about human utilities through interaction. Our approach features two critical
modules: the anticipation module is a motion predictor that captures the
spatial-temporal relationship between the robot agent and user agent, which
contributes to predicting human behavior; the utility module infers the
underlying human utility functions through progressive task demonstration
sampling. Extensive experiments across various robot types and assistive tasks
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances task success and
efficiency but also significantly improves user satisfaction, paving the way
for more personalized and adaptive assistive robotic systems. Code and demos

                                        <span>  The execution of flight missions by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) primarily
relies on navigation. In particular, the navigation pipeline has traditionally
been divided into positioning and control, operating in a sequential loop.
However, the existing navigation pipeline, where the positioning and control
are decoupled, struggles to adapt to ubiquitous uncertainties arising from
measurement noise, abrupt disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics. As a result,
the navigation reliability of the UAV is significantly challenged in complex
dynamic areas. For example, the ubiquitous global navigation satellite system
(GNSS) positioning can be degraded by the signal reflections from surrounding
high-rising buildings in complex urban areas, leading to significantly
increased positioning uncertainty. An additional challenge is introduced to the
control algorithm due to the complex wind disturbances in urban canyons. Given
the fact that the system positioning and control are highly correlated with
each other, this research proposes a **tightly joined positioning and control
model (JPCM) based on factor graph optimization (FGO)**. In particular, the
proposed JPCM combines sensor measurements from positioning and control
constraints into a unified probabilistic factor graph. Specifically, the
positioning measurements are formulated as the factors in the factor graph. In
addition, the model predictive control (MPC) is also formulated as the
additional factors in the factor graph. By solving the factor graph contributed
by both the positioning-related factors and the MPC-based factors, the
complementariness of positioning and control can be deeply exploited. Finally,
we validate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed method using a
simulated quadrotor system which shows significantly improved trajectory
following performance.

component in harnessing the latent potential of mental energy. Its ability to
amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control,
creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based

inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep

interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive

but also provide them with computational capacities. This paper introduces a
fuzzy pneumatic physical reservoir computing (FPRC) model for feedforward
hysteresis compensation in motion tracking control of soft actuators. Our
method utilizes a pneumatic bending actuator as a physical reservoir with
nonlinear computing capacities to control another pneumatic bending actuator.
The FPRC model employs a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy logic to process outputs
from the physical reservoir. The proposed FPRC model shows equivalent training
performance to an Echo State Network (ESN) model, whereas it exhibits better
test accuracies with significantly reduced execution time. Experiments validate
the FPRC model's effectiveness in controlling the bending motion of a pneumatic
soft actuator with open-loop and closed-loop control system setups. The
proposed FPRC model's robustness against environmental disturbances has also
been experimentally verified. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
implementation of a physical system in the feedforward hysteresis compensation
model for controlling soft actuators. This study is expected to advance
physical reservoir computing in nonlinear control applications and extend the
feedforward hysteresis compensation methods for controlling soft actuators.

locomotives) deployment for decarbonizing non-electrified freight rail, we
develop a convex optimization formulation with a closed-form solution to
determine the optimal number of energy storage tender cars in a train. The
formulation shares a similar structure to an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
model. For given market characteristics, cost forecasts, and technology
parameters, our model captures the trade-offs between inventory carrying costs
associated with trip times (including delays due to charging/refueling) and
ordering costs associated with train dispatch and operation (energy, amortized
equipment, and labor costs). To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal
number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets
(origin-destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The
results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more
time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars.
For heavier commodities (e.g., coal) with lower holding costs, single battery
tender car configurations are generally optimal. The results also show that the
optimal train configurations are sensitive to delays associated with recharging
or swapping tender cars.

regulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While
this SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we
show that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is
corrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a
variant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and
prove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In
particular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also
to a trivial solution.

transit frequency and shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet size optimization,
a problem variant of the transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) that
explicitly considers mode choice behavior and route selection. To address the

                                        <span>  In this paper, the mixed equilibrium problem with coupled inequality
constraints in dynamic environments is solved by employing a multi-agent
system, where each agent only has access to its own bifunction, its own
constraint function, and can only communicate with its immediate neighbors via
a time-varying digraph. At each time, the goal of agents is to cooperatively
find a point in the constraint set such that the sum of local bifunctions with
a free variable is non-negative. Different from existing works, here the
bifunctions and the constraint functions are time-varying and only available to
agents after decisions are made. To tackle this problem, first, an online
distributed algorithm involving accurate gradient information is proposed based
on mirror descent algorithms and primal-dual strategies. Of particular interest
is that dynamic regrets, whose offline benchmarks are to find the solution at
each time, are employed to measure the performance of the algorithm. Under mild
assumptions on the graph and the bifunctions, we prove that if the deviation in
the solution sequence grows within a certain rate, then both the dynamic regret
and the violation of coupled inequality constraints increase sublinearly.
Second, considering the case where each agent only has access to a noisy
estimate on the accurate gradient, we propose an online distributed algorithm
involving the stochastic gradients. The result shows that under the same
conditions as in the first case, if the noise distribution satisfies the
sub-Gaussian condition, then dynamic regrets, as well as constraint violations,
increase sublinearly with high probability. Finally, several simulation
examples are presented to corroborate the validity of our results.

create systems capable of making autonomous decisions by learning from their
environment through trial and error. This paper emphasizes the importance of
reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and
effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves
designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while
reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process,
accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements
in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is
the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which
can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately
modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement
learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent
advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved
the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional
state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as
robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a
comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing
on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward
shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the
field, offering insights into future research directions and potential
applications in various domains.

technology that has been recently presented as a potential candidate for beyond
fifth-generation wireless communication networks. In this paper, we propose a
priority-aware user traffic-dependent grouping-based multihop routing scheme
for a RIS-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) device-to-device (D2D)
communication network with spatially correlated channels. Specifically, the
proposed scheme exploits the priority of the users (based on their respective
delay-constrained applications) and the aspect of spatial correlation in the
narrowly spaced reflecting elements of the RISs. Here, based on the other users
in the neighborhood, their respective traffic characteristics, and the already
deployed RISs in the surroundings, we establish a multihop connection for
information transfer from one of the users to its intended receiver. In this
context, we take into account the impact of considering practical discrete
phase shifts at the RIS patches instead of its ideal continuous counterpart.
Moreover, we also claim and demonstrate that the existing classic least
remaining distance (LRD)-based approach is not always the optimal solution.
Finally, numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed strategy
and that it significantly outperforms the existing benchmark schemes in terms
of system performance metrics such as data throughput, energy consumption, as
well as energy efficiency.

infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear system problems presented
in [1]. This controller is synthesized from the solution of a "data-driven
algebraic equation" constructed from the model-free Bellman equation used in
Q-learning. This algebraic equation is driven by data correlation matrices that
does not scale in the number of data points, making for an efficient online
implementation. As a result, a sufficient condition that ensures stability and
robustness against unmodeled dynamics in the plant is extracted. The derived
results also allows for a quantitative characterization of the interplay
between explorations and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal
control problems considered here bears equivalence to Stochastic Shortest Path
(SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed
adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest
path, as presented in the numerical experiment.

                                        <span>  The framework of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems has shown to be a
powerful tool for the design of controllers for complex nonlinear systems using
linear tools. In this work, we derive novel methods that allow to synthesize
LPV state-feedback controllers directly from only a single sequence of data and
guarantee stability and performance of the closed-loop system. We show that if
the measured open-loop data from the system satisfies a persistency of
excitation condition, then the full open-loop and closed-loop
input-scheduling-state behavior can be represented using only the data. With
this representation we formulate data-driven analysis and synthesis problems,
where the latter yields controllers that guarantee stability and performance in
terms of infinite horizon quadratic cost, generalized $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm and
$\ell_2$-gain of the closed-loop system. The controllers are synthesized by
solving a semi-definite program. Additionally, we provide a synthesis method to
handle noisy measurement data. Competitive performance of the proposed
data-driven synthesis methods is demonstrated w.r.t. model-based synthesis in
multiple simulation studies, including a nonlinear unbalanced disc system.

                                        <span>  The nonlinearities of soft robots bring control challenges like hysteresis
but also provide them with computational capacities. This paper introduces a
fuzzy pneumatic physical reservoir computing (FPRC) model for feedforward
hysteresis compensation in motion tracking control of soft actuators. Our
method utilizes a pneumatic bending actuator as a physical reservoir with
nonlinear computing capacities to control another pneumatic bending actuator.
The FPRC model employs a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy logic to process outputs
from the physical reservoir. The proposed FPRC model shows equivalent training
performance to an Echo State Network (ESN) model, whereas it exhibits better
test accuracies with significantly reduced execution time. Experiments validate
the FPRC model's effectiveness in controlling the bending motion of a pneumatic
soft actuator with open-loop and closed-loop control system setups. The
proposed FPRC model's robustness against environmental disturbances has also
been experimentally verified. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
implementation of a physical system in the feedforward hysteresis compensation
model for controlling soft actuators. This study is expected to advance
physical reservoir computing in nonlinear control applications and extend the
feedforward hysteresis compensation methods for controlling soft actuators.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a method to encrypt linear dynamic controllers that
enables an unlimited number of recursive homomorphic multiplications on a Ring
Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem without bootstrapping.
Unlike LWE based schemes, where a scalar error is injected during encryption
for security, Ring-LWE based schemes are based on polynomial rings and inject
error as a polynomial having multiple error coefficients. Such errors
accumulate under recursive homomorphic operations, and it has been studied that
their effect can be suppressed by the closed-loop stability when dynamic
controllers are encrypted using LWE based schemes. We show that this also holds
for the proposed controller encrypted using a Ring-LWE based scheme.
Specifically, only the constant terms of the error polynomials affect the
control performance, and their effect can be arbitrarily bounded even when the
noneffective terms diverge. Furthermore, a novel packing algorithm is applied,
resulting in reduced computation time and enhanced memory efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

                                        <span>  Calibration to experimental data is vital when developing subject-specific
models towards developing digital twins. Yet, to date, subject-specific models
are largely based on cadaveric testing, as in vivo data to calibrate against
has been difficult to obtain until recently. To support our overall goal of
building subject-specific models of the living knee, we aimed to show that
subject-specific computational models built and calibrated using in vivo
measurements would have accuracy comparable to models built using in vitro
measurements. Two knee specimens were imaged using a combination of computed
tomography (CT), and surface scans. Knee laxity measurements were made with a
custom apparatus used for the living knee and from a robotic knee simulator.
Models of the knees were built using the CT geometry and surface scans, and
then calibrated with either laxity data from the robotic knee simulator or from
the knee laxity apparatus. Model performance was compared by simulation of
passive flexion, knee laxity and a clinically relevant pivot shift. Performance
was similar with differences during simulated anterior-posterior laxity tests
of less than 2.5 mm. Additionally, model predictions of a pivot shift were
similar with differences less than 3 deg or 3 mm for rotations and
translations, respectively. Still, differences in the predicted ligament loads
and calibrated material properties emerged, highlighting a need for methods to
include ligament load as part of the underlying calibration process. Overall,
the results showed that currently available methods of measuring knee laxity in
vivo are sufficient to calibrate models comparable with existing in vitro
techniques, and the workflows described here may provide a basis for modeling
the living knee. The models, data, and code are publicly available.

technique for enabling differentially private optimization. Although prior
works extensively investigated clipping with a constant threshold, private
training remains highly sensitive to threshold selection, which can be
expensive or even infeasible to tune. This sensitivity motivates the
development of adaptive approaches, such as quantile clipping, which have
demonstrated empirical success but lack a solid theoretical understanding. This
paper provides the first comprehensive convergence analysis of SGD with
quantile clipping (QC-SGD). We demonstrate that QC-SGD suffers from a bias
problem similar to constant-threshold clipped SGD but show how this can be
mitigated through a carefully designed quantile and step size schedule. Our
analysis reveals crucial relationships between quantile selection, step size,
and convergence behavior, providing practical guidelines for parameter
selection. We extend these results to differentially private optimization,
establishing the first theoretical guarantees for DP-QC-SGD. Our findings
provide theoretical foundations for widely used adaptive clipping heuristic and
highlight open avenues for future research.

provide a characterization of the error term in arbitrary order and dimension,

stochastic Carleman estimates where the asymptotic behavior of the Carleman
weight functions is crucial. The aforementioned asymptotic behavior holds for
Carleman weight functions used for parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic

                                        <span>  The aim of this paper is to solve linear semidefinite programs arising from
higher-order Lasserre relaxations of unconstrained binary quadratic
optimization problems. For this we use an interior point method with a
preconditioned conjugate gradient method solving the linear systems. The
preconditioner utilizes the low-rank structure of the solution of the
relaxations. In order to fully exploit this, we need to re-write the moment
relaxations. To treat the arising linear equality constraints we use an
$\ell_1$-penalty approach within the interior-point solver. The efficiency of
this approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with the MAXCUT and
other randomly generated problems and a comparison with a state-of-the-art
semidefinite solver and the ADMM method. We further propose a hybrid
ADMM-interior-point method that proves to be efficient for certain problem
classes. As a by-product, we observe that the second-order relaxation is often
high enough to deliver a globally optimal solution of the original problem.

locomotives) deployment for decarbonizing non-electrified freight rail, we
develop a convex optimization formulation with a closed-form solution to
determine the optimal number of energy storage tender cars in a train. The
formulation shares a similar structure to an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
model. For given market characteristics, cost forecasts, and technology
parameters, our model captures the trade-offs between inventory carrying costs
associated with trip times (including delays due to charging/refueling) and
ordering costs associated with train dispatch and operation (energy, amortized
equipment, and labor costs). To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal
number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets
(origin-destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The
results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more
time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars.
For heavier commodities (e.g., coal) with lower holding costs, single battery
tender car configurations are generally optimal. The results also show that the
optimal train configurations are sensitive to delays associated with recharging
or swapping tender cars.

(SDP) proposed for direct data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While
this SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we
show that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is
corrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a
variant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and
prove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In
particular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also
to a trivial solution.

                                        <span>  Control theory often takes the mathematical model of the to-be-control-led
system for granted. In contrast, port-Hamiltonian systems theory bridges the
gap between modelling and control for physical systems. It provides a unified
framework for the modelling of complex multiphysics systems. At the same time
it offers powerful tools for analysis and control by identifying the underlying
physical structure, as reflected in, e.g., energy balance and other conserved
quantities. This leads to control schemes that \emph{exploit} the physical
structure, instead of compensating for it. As a result, the derived control
laws tend to be simple, physically interpretable, and robust with respect to
physical parameter variations.
  In this paper, after introducing port-Hamiltonian systems, the focus is on
'control by interconnection' for set-point stabilization of nonlinear physical
systems. Most of this theory is well-established, but novel developments using
'energy ports' instead of 'power ports' are also included.

                                        <span>  Particle flow processing is widely employed across various industrial
applications and technologies. Due to the complex interactions between
particles and fluids, designing effective devices for particle flow processing
is challenging. In this study, we propose a topology optimization method to
design flow fields that effectively enhance the resistance encountered by
particles. Particle flow is simulated using an Eulerian-Eulerian model based on
a finite difference method. Automatic differentiation is implemented to compute
sensitivities using a checkpointing algorithm. We formulate the optimization
problem as maximizing the variation of drag force on particles while reducing
fluid power dissipation. Initially, we validate the finite difference flow
solver through numerical examples of particle flow problems and confirm that
the corresponding topology optimization produces a result comparable to the
benchmark problem. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of Reynolds and
Stokes numbers on the optimized flow field. The numerical results indicate that
serpentine flow fields can effectively enhance the variation in particle drag
force.

nature inherent in the $\ell_p$ quasi-norm with $0<p<1$. We propose a novel
localized approximation method that yields a Lipschitz continuous concave
surrogate function for the $\ell_p$ quasi-norm with improved approximation
quality. Building on this approximation, we enhance the state-of-the-art
iterative reweighted algorithm proposed by Yang et al. (J Mach Learn Res

solves the $\ell_p$ quasinorm ball projection problem through a series of
tractable projections onto the weighted $\ell_1$ norm balls. Convergence
analyses and numerical studies demonstrate the global convergence and superior
computational efficiency of the proposed method.

$S$ be a bounded linear operator from another Hilbert space $Y$ to $X$. We
investigate the non-exponential rate of decay of $\|T^nS\|$ as $n \to \infty$.
First, when $X = Y$ and $S$ commutes with $T$, we characterize the decay rate
of $\|T^nS\|$ by the growth rate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$ as $|\lambda|
\downarrow 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Next, we provide another
characterization by means of an integral estimate of $\|(\lambda I -
T)^{-k}S\|$. The second characterization is then applied to asymptotic
estimates for perturbed discrete operator semigroups. Finally, we present some
results on the relation between the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ and the
boundedness of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\|T^nSy\|^p$ for all $y \in Y$
in the Banach space setting, where $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to(0,\infty)$ and $p

                                        <span>  Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex
stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized
as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations.
Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and
true gradient) is considered only to have a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment
where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies
the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging
setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge
at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate
for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed
algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one
may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the
only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by
revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with
Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result
under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove
that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the
relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first
$\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the
case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is
arguably the common scenario in practice.

the training of deep models by dynamically adjusting the learning rate during
the optimization process. However, adhoc tuning of learning rates poses a
challenge, leading to inefficiencies in practice. To address this issue, recent
research has focused on developing "learning-rate-free" or "parameter-free"
algorithms that operate effectively without the need for learning rate tuning.
Despite these efforts, existing parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam
tend to be overly complex and/or lack formal convergence guarantees. In this
paper, we present AdaGrad++ and Adam++, novel and simple parameter-free
variants of AdaGrad and Adam with convergence guarantees. We prove that
AdaGrad++ achieves comparable convergence rates to AdaGrad in convex
optimization without predefined learning rate assumptions. Similarly, Adam++
matches the convergence rate of Adam without relying on any conditions on the
learning rates. Experimental results across various deep learning tasks
validate the competitive performance of AdaGrad++ and Adam++.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose Riemannian conditional gradient methods for
minimizing composite functions, i.e., those that can be expressed as the sum of
a smooth function and a geodesically convex one. We analyze the convergence of
the proposed algorithms, utilizing three types of step-size strategies:
adaptive, diminishing, and those based on the Armijo condition. We establish
the convergence rate of \(\mathcal{O}(1/k)\) for the adaptive and diminishing
step sizes, where \(k\) denotes the number of iterations. Additionally, we
derive an iteration complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)\) for the Armijo
step-size strategy to achieve \(\epsilon\)-optimality, where \(\epsilon\) is
the optimality tolerance. Finally, the effectiveness of our algorithms is
validated through some numerical experiments performed on the sphere and
Stiefel manifolds.

a problem variant of the transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) that

                                        <span>  We study learning of human preferences from a limited comparison feedback.
This task is ubiquitous in machine learning. Its applications such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been transformational. We
formulate this problem as learning a Plackett-Luce model over a universe of $N$
choices from $K$-way comparison feedback, where typically $K \ll N$. Our
solution is the D-optimal design for the Plackett-Luce objective. The design
defines a data logging policy that elicits comparison feedback for a small
collection of optimally chosen points from all ${N \choose K}$ feasible
subsets. The main algorithmic challenge in this work is that even fast methods
for solving D-optimal designs would have $O({N \choose K})$ time complexity. To
address this issue, we propose a randomized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm that
solves the linear maximization sub-problems in the FW method on randomly chosen
variables. We analyze the algorithm, and evaluate it empirically on synthetic
and open-source NLP datasets.

                                        <span>  Multi-echelon parcel delivery systems using electric vehicles (EVs) are
crucial for managing urban logistics complexity and promoting sustainability.
In multi-echelon systems, particularly within two-stage systems, larger
vehicles transport parcels from a central depot to satellite hubs, where
smaller EVs pick up the parcels and carry out last-mile deliveries. This system
could increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve service reliability.
The two-echelon electric vehicle routing problem (2E-EVRP), an extension of the
traditional two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), addresses EV-specific
challenges such as battery constraints and recharging stations to tackle
environmental impacts, urban congestion, and e-commerce demands. While
effectively reducing costs, energy use, and emissions, the 2E-EVRP faces
modeling challenges due to multi-echelon structures, EV limitations, and
recharging station selection. This paper systematically reviews 2E-EVRP
literature, analyzing key studies. It proposes a classification scheme to
categorize the papers based on the problem variants, objectives, constraints,
and solution methods. It identifies gaps such as delivery tardiness,
environmental trade-offs, multi-objective optimization, multiple depots, split
deliveries, and time-dependent travel conditions. Future research directions
include aligning models with urban policies, integrating parcel lockers,
enabling same-day delivery, and incorporating advanced technologies like
autonomous vehicles. Methodological advancements suggest using machine
learning, reinforcement learning, and simulation-based approaches to enhance
dynamic routing and real-time decision-making. These directions aim to expand
the 2E-EVRP applicability, addressing theoretical and practical challenges in
sustainable urban logistics for future works.

models, in scenarios in which the infected population is constrained to be
lower than a critical threshold imposed by the ICU (intensive care unit)
capacity. The vaccination effort possibly imposed by the health-care deciders
is classically modeled by a control input affecting the epidemic dynamic. After
a preliminary viability analysis the existence of optimal controls is
established, and their structure is characterized by using a state-constrained
version of Pontryagin's theorem. The resulting optimal controls necessarily
have a bang-bang regime with at most one switch. More precisely, the optimal
strategies impose the maximum-allowed vaccination effort in an initial period
of time, which can cease only once the ICU constraint can be satisfied without
further vaccination. The switching times are characterized in order to identify
conditions under which vaccination should be implemented or halted. The
uniqueness of the optimal control is also discussed. Numerical examples
illustrate our theoretical results and the corresponding optimal strategies.
The analysis is eventually extended to the infinite horizon by
$\Gamma$-convergence arguments.

                                        <span>  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be effective in producing
approximate solutions to some vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially when
using policies generated by encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. While these
techniques have been quite successful for relatively simple problem instances,
there are still under-researched and highly complex VRP variants for which no
effective RL method has been demonstrated. In this work we focus on one such
VRP variant, which contains multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements.
In these problems, demand is required to move along sequences of nodes, instead
of just from a start node to an end node. With the goal of making deep RL a
viable strategy for real-world industrial-scale supply chain logistics, we
develop new extensions to existing encoder-decoder attention models which allow
them to handle multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. Our models
have the advantage that they can be trained for a small number of trucks and
nodes, and then embedded into a large supply chain to yield solutions for
larger numbers of trucks and nodes. We test our approach on a real supply chain
environment arising in the operations of Japanese automotive parts manufacturer
Aisin Corporation, and find that our algorithm outperforms Aisin's previous
best solution.

                                        <span>  In this work, we develop a spatial SEIAR-type epidemic model considering a
quarantined population (denoted as Q), which we call the SQEIAR model. The
dynamics of the SQEIAR model are described by six Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs) that represent the changes in the susceptible, quarantined,
exposed, asymptomatic, infected, and recovered populations. Our goal is to
reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and infected
individuals while accounting for the environment, which plays a critical role
in the spread of epidemics. We then propose a novel strategy for epidemic
control, incorporating two key control measures: regional quarantine for the
susceptible population and treatment for the infected. This approach serves as
an alternative to widespread quarantine, minimizing the economic, social, and
other potential impacts. Additionally, we consider the possibility of
reinfection among recovered individuals, a common occurrence in many diseases.
To demonstrate the practical utility of our results, a numerical example
centered on COVID-19 is presented.

infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear system problems presented
in [1]. This controller is synthesized from the solution of a "data-driven
algebraic equation" constructed from the model-free Bellman equation used in
Q-learning. This algebraic equation is driven by data correlation matrices that
does not scale in the number of data points, making for an efficient online
implementation. As a result, a sufficient condition that ensures stability and
robustness against unmodeled dynamics in the plant is extracted. The derived
results also allows for a quantitative characterization of the interplay
between explorations and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal
control problems considered here bears equivalence to Stochastic Shortest Path
(SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed
adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest
path, as presented in the numerical experiment.

                                        <span>  The stochastic gradient descent method with momentum (SGDM) is a common
approach for solving large-scale and stochastic optimization problems. Despite
its popularity, the convergence behavior of SGDM remains less understood in
nonconvex scenarios. This is primarily due to the absence of a sufficient
descent property and challenges in simultaneously controlling the momentum and
stochastic errors in an almost sure sense. To address these challenges, we
investigate the behavior of SGDM over specific time windows, rather than
examining the descent of consecutive iterates as in traditional studies. This
time window-based approach simplifies the convergence analysis and enables us
to establish the iterate convergence result for SGDM under the {\L}ojasiewicz
property. We further provide local convergence rates which depend on the
underlying {\L}ojasiewicz exponent and the utilized step size schemes.

                                        <span>  Neural operators are aiming at approximating operators mapping between Banach
spaces of functions, achieving much success in the field of scientific
computing. Compared to certain deep learning-based solvers, such as
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Ritz Method (DRM), neural
operators can solve a class of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Although
much work has been done to analyze the approximation and generalization error
of neural operators, there is still a lack of analysis on their training error.
In this work, we conduct the convergence analysis of gradient descent for the
wide shallow neural operators within the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK). The core idea lies on the fact that over-parameterization and random
initialization together ensure that each weight vector remains near its
initialization throughout all iterations, yielding the linear convergence of
gradient descent. In this work, we demonstrate that under the setting of
over-parametrization, gradient descent can find the global minimum regardless
of whether it is in continuous time or discrete time. Finally, we briefly
discuss the case of physics-informed shallow neural operators.

optimization problems, by the token of the Douglas-Rachford envelope, a merit
function akin to the Moreau envelope. First, we use epi-convergence techniques
to show that this artifact approximates the original objective function via
epigraphs. Secondly, we present how global convergence and local linear
convergence rates for Douglas-Rachford splitting can be obtained using such
envelope, under mild regularity assumptions. The keystone of the convergence
analysis is the fact that the Douglas-Rachford envelope satisfies a sufficient
descent inequality alongside the generated sequence, a feature that allows us
to use arguments usually employed for descent methods. We report numerical
experiments that use weakly convex penalty functions, which are comparable with
the known behavior of the method in the convex case.

                                        <span>  It is imperative to develop an intrusion prevention system (IPS),
specifically designed for autonomous robotic systems. This is due to the unique
nature of these cyber-physical systems (CPS), which are not merely typical
distributed systems. These systems employ their own systems software (i.e.
robotic middleware and frameworks) and execute distinct components to
facilitate interaction with various sensors and actuators, and other robotic
components (e.g. cognitive subsystems). Furthermore, as cyber-physical systems,
they engage in interactions with humans and their physical environment, as
exemplified by social robots. These interactions can potentially lead to
serious consequences, including physical damage. In response to this need, we
have designed and implemented RIPS, an intrusion prevention system tailored for
robotic applications based on ROS 2, the framework that has established itself
as the de facto standard for developing robotic applications. This manuscript
provides a comprehensive exposition of the issue, the security aspects of ROS 2
applications, and the key points of the threat model we created for our robotic
environment. It also describes the architecture and the implementation of our
initial research prototype and a language specifically designed for defining
detection and prevention rules for diverse, real-world robotic scenarios.
Moreover, the manuscript provides a comprehensive evaluation of the approach,
that includes a set of experiments with a real social robot executing a well
known testbed used in international robotic competitions.

with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to facilitate mobile robot
navigation through task-based human instruction. By adopting a curriculum that
mirrors the progressive complexity encountered in human learning, our approach
systematically enhances robots' ability to interpret and execute complex
instructions over time. We explore the principles of DRL and its synergy with
ICL, demonstrating how this combination not only improves training efficiency
but also equips mobile robots with the generalization capability required for
navigating through dynamic indoor environments. Empirical results indicate that
robots trained with our ICL-enhanced DRL framework outperform those trained
without curriculum learning, highlighting the benefits of structured learning
progressions in robotic training.

                                        <span>  Robot simulators are indispensable tools across many fields, and recent
research has significantly improved their functionality by incorporating
additional gradient information. However, existing differentiable robot
simulators suffer from non-differentiable singularities, when robots undergo
substantial shape changes. To address this, we present the Shape-Differentiable
Robot Simulator (SDRS), designed to be differentiable under significant robot
shape changes. The core innovation of SDRS lies in its representation of robot
shapes using a set of convex polyhedrons. This approach allows us to generalize
smooth, penalty-based contact mechanics for interactions between any pair of
convex polyhedrons. Using the separating hyperplane theorem, SDRS introduces a
separating plane for each pair of contacting convex polyhedrons. This
separating plane functions as a zero-mass auxiliary entity, with its state
determined by the principle of least action. This setup ensures global
differentiability, even as robot shapes undergo significant geometric and
topological changes. To demonstrate the practical value of SDRS, we provide
examples of robot co-design scenarios, where both robot shapes and control
movements are optimized simultaneously.

of open-vocabulary object manipulation. In this task, the model is required to
make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images
before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional
methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is
executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We
propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by
aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions.
We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input
trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions
between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict
manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1
dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks,
to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our method achieved
a higher prediction accuracy than baseline approaches.

                                        <span>  Event cameras are neuromorphically inspired sensors that sparsely and
asynchronously report brightness changes. Their unique characteristics of high
temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption make them
well-suited for addressing challenges in monocular depth estimation (e.g.,
high-speed or low-lighting conditions). However, current existing methods
primarily treat event streams as black-box learning systems without
incorporating prior physical principles, thus becoming over-parameterized and
failing to fully exploit the rich temporal information inherent in event camera
data. To address this limitation, we incorporate physical motion principles to
propose an interpretable monocular depth estimation framework, where the
likelihood of various depth hypotheses is explicitly determined by the effect
of motion compensation. To achieve this, we propose a Focus Cost Discrimination
(FCD) module that measures the clarity of edges as an essential indicator of
focus level and integrates spatial surroundings to facilitate cost estimation.
Furthermore, we analyze the noise patterns within our framework and improve it
with the newly introduced Inter-Hypotheses Cost Aggregation (IHCA) module,
where the cost volume is refined through cost trend prediction and multi-scale
cost consistency constraints. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms cutting-edge
methods by up to 10\% in terms of the absolute relative error metric, revealing
superior performance in predicting accuracy.

Floyd algorithm is used to generate the shortest paths for UAVs to fly from any
place to the destination in a large-scale field with obstacles which UAVs
cannot fly over. The simulation results demonstrated that Floyd algorithm
effectively plans the shortest obstacle-free paths for UAVs to fly to a
destination. It is verified that Floyd algorithm holds a time complexity of
O(n3). This research revealed a correlation of a cubic polynomial relationship
between the time cost and the size of the field, no correlation between the
time cost and the number of obstacles, and no correlation between the time cost
and the number of UAVs in the tested field. The applications of the research
results are discussed in the paper as well.

human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a
LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution.
Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance,
which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the
instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates
outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work

driving, enabling the generation of novel data from existing datasets to
simulate safety-critical scenarios and expand training data without additional
acquisition costs. Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time,
photorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the
scene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the
implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has
yielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they
overlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on
low-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway
scenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs
are commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn
primarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without
precise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth
information LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In
this paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and
editing with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and
support for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban
datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more
challenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with
sparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds. Visit our project page at:

                                        <span>  Learning an effective policy to control high-dimensional, overactuated
systems is a significant challenge for deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
Such control scenarios are often observed in the neural control of vertebrate
musculoskeletal systems. The study of these control mechanisms will provide
insights into the control of high-dimensional, overactuated systems. The
coordination of actuators, known as muscle synergies in neuromechanics, is
considered a presumptive mechanism that simplifies the generation of motor
commands. The dynamical structure of a system is the basis of its function,
allowing us to derive a synergistic representation of actuators. Motivated by
this theory, we propose the Dynamical Synergistic Representation (DynSyn)
algorithm. DynSyn aims to generate synergistic representations from dynamical
structures and perform task-specific, state-dependent adaptation to the
representations to improve motor control. We demonstrate DynSyn's efficiency
across various tasks involving different musculoskeletal models, achieving
state-of-the-art sample efficiency and robustness compared to baseline
algorithms. DynSyn generates interpretable synergistic representations that
capture the essential features of dynamical structures and demonstrates
generalizability across diverse motor tasks.

                                        <span>  In multi-robot systems, relative localization between platforms plays a
crucial role in many tasks, such as leader following, target tracking, or
cooperative maneuvering. State of the Art (SotA) approaches either rely on
infrastructure-based or on infrastructure-less setups. The former typically
achieve high localization accuracy but require fixed external structures. The
latter provide more flexibility, however, most of the works use cameras or
lidars that require Line-of-Sight (LoS) to operate. Ultra Wide Band (UWB)
devices are emerging as a viable alternative to build infrastructure-less
solutions that do not require LoS. These approaches directly deploy the UWB
sensors on the robots. However, they require that at least one of the platforms
is static, limiting the advantages of an infrastructure-less setup. In this
work, we remove this constraint and introduce an active method for
infrastructure-less relative localization. Our approach allows the robot to
adapt its position to minimize the relative localization error of the other
platform. To this aim, we first design a specialized anchor placement for the
active localization task. Then, we propose a novel UWB Relative Localization
Loss that adapts the Geometric Dilution Of Precision metric to the
infrastructure-less scenario. Lastly, we leverage this loss function to train
an active Deep Reinforcement Learning-based controller for UWB relative
localization. An extensive simulation campaign and real-world experiments
validate our method, showing up to a 60% reduction of the localization error
compared to current SotA approaches.

                                        <span>  In the last decade, data-driven approaches have become popular choices for
quadrotor control, thanks to their ability to facilitate the adaptation to
unknown or uncertain flight conditions. Among the different data-driven
paradigms, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is currently one of the most
explored. However, the design of DRL agents for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs)
remains an open challenge. While some works have studied the output
configuration of these agents (i.e., what kind of control to compute), there is
no general consensus on the type of input data these approaches should employ.
Multiple works simply provide the DRL agent with full state information,
without questioning if this might be redundant and unnecessarily complicate the
learning process, or pose superfluous constraints on the availability of such
information in real platforms. In this work, we provide an in-depth benchmark
analysis of different configurations of the observation space. We optimize
multiple DRL agents in simulated environments with different input choices and
study their robustness and their sim-to-real transfer capabilities with
zero-shot adaptation. We believe that the outcomes and discussions presented in
this work supported by extensive experimental results could be an important
milestone in guiding future research on the development of DRL agents for
aerial robot tasks.

real-world demonstrations for a family of placing tasks in which objects must
be manipulated to specific, contact-constrained locations. With PvP, we
approach the collection of robotic object placement demonstrations by reversing
the grasping process and exploiting the inherent symmetry of the pick and place
problems. Specifically, we obtain placing demonstrations from a set of grasp
sequences of objects initially located at their target placement locations. Our
system can collect hundreds of demonstrations in contact-constrained
environments without human intervention using two modules: compliant control
for grasping and tactile regrasping. We train a policy directly from visual
observations through behavioural cloning, using the autonomously-collected
demonstrations. By doing so, the policy can generalize to object placement
scenarios outside of the training environment without privileged information
(e.g., placing a plate picked up from a table). We validate our approach in
home robot scenarios that include dishwasher loading and table setting. Our
approach yields robotic placing policies that outperform policies trained with
kinesthetic teaching, both in terms of success rate and data efficiency, while
requiring no human supervision.

                                        <span>  We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition
based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot
photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via
reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual
language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference
images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to
retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through
text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene,
we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing
semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features,
we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a
perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a
manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos
taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by
users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can
generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models to
human preferences by employing a singular reward model derived from preference
data. However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human
preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we
first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF,
thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human
preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a
mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm
and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the
Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human
preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to
distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby
highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present
comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale
language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach
in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an
average improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF
algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33%
without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the
robustness and fairness of our approach. We remark that our findings in this
work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement
learning in general.

                                        <span>  As power systems become more complex with the continuous integration of
intelligent distributed energy resources (DERs), new risks and uncertainties
arise. Consequently, to enhance system resiliency, it is essential to account
for various uncertain events when implementing the optimization problem for the
energy management system (EMS). This paper presents a preventive EMS
considering the probability of failure (PoF) of each system component across
different scenarios. A conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR)-based framework is
proposed to integrate the uncertainties of the distribution network. Loads are
classified into critical, semi-critical, and non-critical categories to
prioritize essential loads during generation resource shortages. A proximal
policy optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to
solve the formulated problem and generate the control decisions. The proposed
framework is evaluated on a notional MVDC ship system and a modified IEEE
30-bus system, where the results demonstrate that the PPO agent can
successfully optimize the objective function while maintaining the network and
operational constraints. For validation, the RL-based method is benchmarked
against a traditional optimization approach, further highlighting its
effectiveness and robustness. This comparison shows that RL agents can offer
more resiliency against future uncertain events compared to the traditional
solution methods due to their adaptability and learning capacity.

global carbon emissions in 2023, which brings great pressure for achieving
net-zero carbon emission targets in the future. Under the above background,
hydrogen-penetrated multi-energy systems (HMESs) have received wide attention
due to their potential low-carbon attribute. However, HMESs still face the
following challenge, i.e., how to survive and quickly recover from extreme and
unexpected events (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyber-physical
attacks). To enable the above resilience attribute, many existing works on HMES
resilience enhancement have been done. However, there lacks a systematic
overview of different resilience enhancement measures for HMESs. To fill the
research gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of resilience
enhancement strategies for HMESs from the perspective of hydrogen-related
planning and operation. To be specific, we propose a comprehensive resilience
enhancement framework for HEMSs. Under the proposed framework, the widely used
resilience metrics and event-oriented contingency models in existing works are
summarized. Then, we classify the hydrogen-related planning measures for HMES
resilience enhancement according to the type of hydrogen-related facilities and
provide some insights for planning problem formulation framework. Moreover, we
categorize the hydrogen-related operation measures for HMES resilience
enhancement according to the three kinds of operation response stages involved,
including preventive response, emergency response, and restoration response.
Finally, we identify some research gaps and point out possible future
directions.

production via electrolysis is expected to gain importance as a means for
energy storage and flexible load to complement variable renewable generation.
With the increasing need for cost-effective and efficient hydrogen production,
electrolyzer optimization is essential to improve both energy efficiency and
profitability. This paper analyzes how the efficiency and modular setup of
alkaline hydrogen electrolyzers can improve hydrogen output of systems linked
to a fluctuating renewable power supply. To explore this, we propose a
day-ahead optimal scheduling problem of a hybrid wind and electrolyzer system.
The novelty of our approach lies in modeling the number and capacity of
electrolyzer modules, and capturing the modules' impact on the hydrogen
production and efficiency. We solve the resulting mixed-integer optimization
problem with several different combinations of number of modules, efficiency
and operating range parameters, using day-ahead market data from a wind farm
generator in the ERCOT system as an input. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed approach ensures that electrolyzer owners can better optimize the
operation of their systems, achieving greater hydrogen production and higher
revenue. Key findings include that as the number of modules in a system with
the same overall capacity increases, hydrogen production and revenue increases.

achieve high performance while ensuring robust stability, particularly for
nonlinear systems. In this work, we tackle the challenge of designing optimal
output-feedback controllers to boost the performance of $\ell_p$-stable
discrete-time nonlinear systems while preserving closed-loop stability from
external disturbances to input and output channels. Leveraging operator theory
and neural network representations, we parametrize the achievable closed-loop
maps for a given system and propose novel parametrizations of all
$\ell_p$-stabilizing controllers, unifying frameworks such as nonlinear Youla
and Internal Model Control. Contributing to a rapidly growing research line,
our approach enables unconstrained optimization exclusively over stabilizing
output-feedback controllers and provides sufficient conditions to ensure
robustness against model mismatch. Additionally, our methods reveal that
stronger notions of stability can be imposed on the closed-loop maps if
disturbance realizations are available after one time step. Last, our
approaches are compatible with the design of nonlinear distributed controllers.
Numerical experiments on cooperative robotics demonstrate the flexibility of
our framework, allowing cost functions to be freely designed for achieving
complex behaviors while preserving stability.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a robust position controller for electric power assisted
steering and steer-by-wire force-feedback systems. A position controller is
required in steering systems for haptic feedback control, advanced driver
assistance systems and automated driving. However, the driver's
\textit{physical} arm impedance causes an inertial uncertainty during coupling.
Consequently, a typical position controller, i.e., based on single variable,
becomes less robust and suffers tracking performance loss. Therefore, a robust
position controller is investigated.
  The proposed solution is based on the multi-variable concept such that the
sensed driver torque signal is also included in the position controller. The
subsequent solution is obtained by solving the LMI$-H_{\infty}$ optimization
problem. As a result, the desired loop gain shape is achieved, i.e., large gain
at low frequencies for performance and small gain at high frequencies for
robustness.
  Finally, frequency response comparison of different position controllers on
real hardware is presented. Experiments and simulation results clearly
illustrate the improvements in reference tracking and robustness with the
proposed $H_\infty$ controller.

                                        <span>  Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography,
quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential
applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an
extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission
of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of
techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already
deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with
challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and
management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the
joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance
with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This
article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed
and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure)
testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the
telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules
from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The
modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130
km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict
service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing
classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility
at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and
encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was
intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of
large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of
MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases
were showcased.

stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes and periods
simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and
transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet
size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is
developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to
the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without
relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple
operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and
deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers,
assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers
across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in
Chicago, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted
journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 5.76% under single-route and
multi-period multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit
agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource
allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without
additional operational costs.

important for autonomous trajectory planning for reach-avoid applications and
safety critical scenarios. Providing the reachable set is generally impossible
when the dynamics are unknown, so we calculate underapproximations of such sets
using local dynamics at a single point and bounds on the rate of change of the
dynamics determined from known physical laws. Motivated by scenarios where an
adverse event causes an abrupt change in the dynamics, we attempt to determine
a provably reachable set of states without knowledge of the dynamics. This
paper considers systems which are known to operate on a manifold.
Underapproximations are calculated by utilizing the aforementioned knowledge to
derive a guaranteed set of velocities on the tangent bundle of a complete
Riemannian manifold that can be reached within a finite time horizon. We then
interpret said set as a control system; the trajectories of this control system
provide us with a guaranteed set of reachable states the unknown system can
reach within a given time. The results are general enough to apply on systems
that operate on any complete Riemannian manifold. To illustrate the practical
implementation of our results, we apply our algorithm to a model of a pendulum
operating on a sphere and a three-dimensional rotational system which lives on
the abstract set of special orthogonal matrices.

to reduce communication while ensuring performance guarantees, but their design
has grown increasingly complex by incorporating the agent's local and neighbor
information. This typically results in ad-hoc solutions, which may only work
for the consensus protocol under consideration. We aim to safely incorporate
neural networks in the ETM to provide a general solution while guaranteeing
performance. To decouple the stability analysis of the consensus protocol from
the abstraction of the neural network, we derive design criteria for the
consensus and ETM pair, allowing independent analysis of each element under
mild constraints. Then, we propose NN-ETM, a novel ETM featuring a neural
network, to optimize communication while preserving the stability guarantees of
the consensus protocol.

Specifically, we construct time-dependent controls $\theta=(w, a, b)$ in the
vector field $w(a^\top x + b)_+$ to approximately transport a known base
density $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$ to a target density $\rho_*$. The approximation
error is measured in relative entropy, and $\theta$ are constructed piecewise
constant, with bounds on the number of switches being provided. Our main result
relies on an assumption on the relative tail decay of $\rho_*$ and
$\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$, and provides hints on characterizing the reachable space
of the continuity equation in relative entropy.

                                        <span>  This work is motivated by the challenges of applying the sample average
approximation (SAA) method to multistage stochastic programming with an unknown
continuous-state Markov process. While SAA is widely used in static and
two-stage stochastic optimization, it becomes computationally intractable in
general multistage settings as the time horizon $T$ increases. Indeed, the
number of samples required to obtain a reasonably accurate solution grows
exponentially$\text{ -- }$a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality
with respect to the time horizon. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
novel data-driven approach, the Markov Recombining Scenario Tree (MRST) method,
which constructs an approximate problem using only two independent trajectories
of historical data. Our analysis demonstrates that the MRST method achieves
polynomial sample complexity in $T$, providing a more efficient alternative to
SAA. Numerical experiments on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian problem show that
MRST outperforms SAA, addressing the curse of dimensionality.

                                        <span>  We study the problem of contextual dynamic pricing with a linear demand
model. We propose a novel localized exploration-then-commit (LetC) algorithm
which starts with a pure exploration stage, followed by a refinement stage that
explores near the learned optimal pricing policy, and finally enters a pure
exploitation stage. The algorithm is shown to achieve a minimax optimal,
dimension-free regret bound when the time horizon exceeds a polynomial of the
covariate dimension. Furthermore, we provide a general theoretical framework
that encompasses the entire time spectrum, demonstrating how to balance
exploration and exploitation when the horizon is limited. The analysis is
powered by a novel critical inequality that depicts the
exploration-exploitation trade-off in dynamic pricing, mirroring its existing
counterpart for the bias-variance trade-off in regularized regression. Our
theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world data.

                                        <span>  The design of porous infill structures presents significant challenges due to
their complex geometric configurations, such as the accurate representation of
geometric boundaries and the control of localized maximum stress. In current
mainstream design methods, such as topology optimization, the analysis is often
performed using pixel or voxel-based element approximations. These
approximations, constrained by the optimization framework, result in
substantial geometric discrepancies between the analysis model and the final
physical model. Such discrepancies can severely impact structural performance,
particularly for localized properties like stress response, where accurate
geometry is critical to mitigating stress concentration. To address these
challenges, we propose evolutionary de-homogenization, which is a design
framework based on the integration of de-homogenization and data-driven
multifidelity optimization. This framework facilitates the hybrid solid-porous
infill design by bridging the gap between low-fidelity analysis and
high-fidelity physical realizations, ensuring both geometric accuracy and
enhanced structural performance. The low-fidelity level utilizes commonly used
density control variables, while the high-fidelity level involves stress
analysis based on structures with precise geometric representations. By
employing a de-homogenization-based mapping method, a side-by-side
correspondence between low-fidelity and high-fidelity results is established.
The low-fidelity control variables are iteratively adjusted to optimize the
high-fidelity results by integrating deep generative model with multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

characterized by regime switching and Poisson jumps. All the coefficients in
the problem are random processes adapted to the filtration generated by
Brownian motion and the Poisson random measure for each given regime. The model
incorporates two distinct types of controls: the first is a conventional
control that appears in the continuous diffusion component, while the second is
an unconventional control, dependent on the variable $z$, which influences the
jump size in the jump diffusion component. Both controls are constrained within
general closed cones. By employing the Meyer-It\^o formula in conjunction with
a generalized squares completion technique, we rigorously and explicitly derive
the optimal value and optimal feedback control. These depend on solutions to
certain multi-dimensional fully coupled stochastic Riccati equations, which are
essentially backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (BSDEJs). We
establish the existence of a unique nonnegative solution to the BSDEJs. One of
the major tools used in the proof is the newly established comparison theorems
for multidimensional BSDEJs.

problem where the noises of individual agents are correlated. Compared with the
well-studied mean field system, the graphon field system consists of a large
number of agents coupled weakly via a weighted undirected graph where each node
represents an individual agent. Another notable feature of this paper is that
the dynamics of states of agents are driven by Brownian motions with a
correlation matrix. The infinite dimensional approach is adopted to design the
centralized and decentralized controls for our large population system. By
graphon theory, we prove that the linear quadratic (LQ) social optimum control
problem under the centralized information pattern is equivalent to an LQ
optimal control problem concerned with a stochastic evolution equation, and the
feedback-type optimal centralized control is obtained. Then, by designing an
auxiliary infinite dimensional optimal control problem through agent number
$N\rightarrow\infty$, a set of decentralized strategies are constructed, which
are further shown to be asymptotically social optimal.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a boundary control scheme for prescribed-time (PT) stable
of flexible string systems via backstepping method, and the dynamics of such
systems modeled by Hamilton's principle is described as hyperbolic partial
differential equation (PDE). Initially, to construct a boundary controller with
PT stabilization capacity, a PT stable hyperbolic PDE system with time-varying
coefficient is chosen as the target system, and a corresponding Volterra
integral transform with time-varying kernel function is considered. Meanwhile,
the kernel equation and controller is determined by taking derivative. Then, to
identify the boundary controller, the well-posedness of kernel equation is
derived by means of successive approximation and mathematical induction, and
the upper bound of kernel function is estimated. Furthermore, the inverse
transform is proved with the help of a similar process for kernel function.
Subsequently, the PT stability of closed-loop system is proved by PT stability
of target system and reversible integral transform. Finally, the simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.

                                        <span>  Column Generation (CG) is an effective and iterative algorithm to solve
large-scale linear programs (LP). During each CG iteration, new columns are
added to improve the solution of the LP. Typically, CG greedily selects one
column with the most negative reduced cost, which can be improved by adding
more columns at once. However, selecting all columns with negative reduced
costs would lead to the addition of redundant columns that do not improve the
objective value. Therefore, selecting the appropriate columns to add is still
an open problem and previous machine-learning-based approaches for CG only add
a constant quantity of columns per iteration due to the state-space explosion
problem. To address this, we propose Fast Family Column Generation (FFCG) -- a
novel reinforcement-learning-based CG that selects a variable number of columns
as needed in an iteration. Specifically, we formulate the column selection
problem in CG as an MDP and design a reward metric that balances both the
convergence speed and the number of redundant columns. In our experiments, FFCG
converges faster on the common benchmarks and reduces the number of CG
iterations by 77.1% for Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) and 84.8% for Vehicle
Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), and a 71.4% reduction in computing
time for CSP and 84.0% for VRPTW on average compared to several
state-of-the-art baselines.

feature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and

The existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the

uniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely
minimal solutions established in most related literature.

                                        <span>  In this paper, based on the Tikhonov regularization technique, we study a
monotone general variational inequality (GVI) by considering an associated
strongly monotone GVI, depending on a regularization parameter $\alpha,$ such
that the latter admits a unique solution $x_\alpha$ which tends to some
solution of the initial GVI, as $\alpha \to 0.$ However, instead of solving the
regularized GVI for each $\alpha$, which may be very expensive, we consider a
neural network (also known as a dynamical system) associated with the
regularized GVI and establish the existence and the uniqueness of the strong
global solution to the corresponding Cauchy problem. An explicit discretization
of this neural network leads to strongly convergent iterative regularization
algorithms for monotone general variational inequality. Numerical tests are
performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
  This work extends our recent results in [Anh, Hai, Optim. Eng. 25 (2024)

                                        <span>  In this paper, we develop a novel and simple adaptive control scheme for a
one-dimensional unstable heat equation with unknown control coefficient. A new
state observer is designed to estimate the system state, while a new update law
is devised to estimate the reciprocal of the control coefficient. In contrast
with the conventional state observer which is usually available for all
controllers, the newly designed state observer depends on a special controller
factorization. Very importantly, both the unknown control coefficient and its
corresponding estimate do not appear in the state observer anymore.
Consequently, the stabilization of the control plant comes down to the
stabilization of the state observer. In this way, the obstacles caused by the
unknown control coefficient can be overcome thoroughly. As an application, the
performance output tracking is also considered by the newly developed approach.
When the reference signal is persistently exciting, the reciprocal of the
control coefficient can be estimated effectively by the designed update law.
All the aforementioned results are proved mathematically, although the
resulting closed-loop system may be nonlinear. Some of them are validated
visually by numerical simulations.

stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes and periods
simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and
transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet
size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is
developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to
the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without
relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple
operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and
deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers,
assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers
across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in
Chicago, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted
journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 5.76% under single-route and
multi-period multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit
agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource
allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without
additional operational costs.

describes population models structured by age, size, and spatial position. The
control is localized with respect to space, age and size; an estimate of the

controllability of the model using a technique that avoids the explicit use of
parabolic Carleman estimates. Instead, this method combines the observability
estimates of the final state with the use of characteristics and estimates of
the associated semigroup. Furthermore, we extend this work by highlighting the
difference in controllability time for two models with different birth kernels.

                                        <span>  We consider the optimal appointment scheduling problem that incorporates
patients' unpunctual behavior, where the unpunctuality is assumed to be time
dependent, but additive. Our goal is to develop an optimal scheduling method
for a large patient system to maximize expected net revenue. Methods for
deriving optimal appointment schedules for large-scale systems often run into
computational bottlenecks due to mixed-integer programming or robust
optimization formulations and computationally complex search methods. In this
work, we model the system as a single-server queueing system, where patients
arrive unpunctually and follow the FIFO service discipline to see the doctor
(i.e., get into service). Using the heavy traffic fluid approximation, we
develop a deterministic control problem, referred to as the fluid control
problem (FCP), which serves as an asymptotic upper bound for the original
queueing control problem (QCP). Using the optimal solution of the FCP, we
establish an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy on a fluid scale. We
further investigate the convergence rate of the QCP under the proposed policy.
The FCP, due to the incorporation of unpunctuality, is difficult to solve
analytically. We thus propose a time-discretized numerical scheme to
approximately solve the FCP. The discretized FCP takes the form of a quadratic
program with linear constraints. We examine the behavior of these schedules
under different unpunctuality assumptions and test the performance of the
schedules on real data in a simulation study. Interestingly, the optimal
schedules can involve block booking of patients, even if the unpunctuality
distributions are continuous.

undirected graph and no server node. The estimation of the $s$-sparse parameter
is formulated as a constrained LASSO problem wherein each agent owns a subset
of the $N$ total observations. We analyze the convergence rate and statistical
guarantees of a distributed projected gradient tracking-based algorithm under
high-dimensional scaling, allowing the ambient dimension $d$ to grow with (and
possibly exceed) the sample size $N$. Our theory shows that, under standard
notions of restricted strong convexity and smoothness of the loss functions,
suitable conditions on the network connectivity and algorithm tuning, the
distributed algorithm converges globally at a {\it linear} rate to an estimate
that is within the centralized {\it statistical precision} of the model,
$O(s\log d/N)$. When $s\log d/N=o(1)$, a condition necessary for statistical
consistency, an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution is attained after
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa \log (1/\varepsilon))$ gradient computations and $O
(\kappa/(1-\rho) \log (1/\varepsilon))$ communication rounds, where $\kappa$ is
the restricted condition number of the loss function and $\rho$ measures the
network connectivity. The computation cost matches that of the centralized
projected gradient algorithm despite having data distributed; whereas the
communication rounds reduce as the network connectivity improves. Overall, our
study reveals interesting connections between statistical efficiency, network
connectivity \& topology, and convergence rate in high dimensions.

                                        <span>  We propose a Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging (RAMDA) algorithm
for training structured neural networks. Similar to existing regularized
adaptive methods, the subproblem for computing the update direction of RAMDA
involves a nonsmooth regularizer and a diagonal preconditioner, and therefore
does not possess a closed-form solution in general. We thus also carefully
devise an implementable inexactness condition that retains convergence
guarantees similar to the exact versions, and propose a companion efficient
solver for the subproblems of both RAMDA and existing methods to make them
practically feasible. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in
variational analysis to show that, even in the presence of such inexactness,
the iterates of RAMDA attain the ideal structure induced by the regularizer at
the stationary point of asymptotic convergence. This structure is locally
optimal near the point of convergence, so RAMDA is guaranteed to obtain the
best structure possible among all methods converging to the same point, making
it the first regularized adaptive method outputting models that possess
outstanding predictive performance while being (locally) optimally structured.
Extensive numerical experiments in large-scale modern computer vision, language
modeling, and speech tasks show that the proposed RAMDA is efficient and
consistently outperforms state of the art for training structured neural
network. Implementation of our algorithm is available at

average of their local cost functions combined with a common nonsmooth
function. This paper introduces a unified algorithmic framework for solving
such a problem through distributed stochastic proximal gradient methods,
leveraging the normal map update scheme. Within this framework, we propose two
new algorithms, termed Normal Map-based Distributed Stochastic Gradient
Tracking (norM-DSGT) and Normal Map-based Exact Diffusion (norM-ED), to solve
the distributed composite optimization problem over a connected network. We
demonstrate that both methods can asymptotically achieve comparable convergence
rates to the centralized stochastic proximal gradient descent method under a
general variance condition on the stochastic gradients. Additionally, the
number of iterations required for norM-ED to achieve such a rate (i.e., the
transient time) behaves as $\mathcal{O}(n^{3}/(1-\lambda)^2)$ for minimizing
composite objective functions, matching the performance of the non-proximal ED
algorithm. Here $1-\lambda$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix
related to the underlying network topology. To our knowledge, such a
convergence result is state-of-the-art for the considered composite problem.
Under the same condition, norM-DSGT enjoys a transient time of
$\mathcal{O}(\max\{n^3/(1-\lambda)^2, n/(1-\lambda)^4\})$ and behaves more
stable than norM-ED under decaying stepsizes for solving the tested problems.

with the knowledge of these constants. In addition to that, we show that a

gradient-based algorithms in classifying linearly separable data. We present an
in-depth analysis of the specific properties of the velocity field associated
with (normalized) gradients, focusing on their role in margin maximization.
Inspired by this analysis, we propose a novel algorithm called Progressive
Rescaling Gradient Descent (PRGD) and show that PRGD can maximize the margin at
an {\em exponential rate}. This stands in stark contrast to all existing
algorithms, which maximize the margin at a slow {\em polynomial rate}.
Specifically, we identify mild conditions on data distribution under which
existing algorithms such as gradient descent (GD) and normalized gradient
descent (NGD) {\em provably fail} in maximizing the margin efficiently. To
validate our theoretical findings, we present both synthetic and real-world
experiments. Notably, PRGD also shows promise in enhancing the generalization
performance when applied to linearly non-separable datasets and deep neural
networks.

                                        <span>  This paper considers consumption and portfolio optimization problems with
recursive preferences in both infinite and finite time regions. Specially, the
financial market consists of a risk-free asset and a risky asset that follows a
general stochastic volatility process. By using Bellman's dynamic programming
principle, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived for
characterizing the optimal consumption-investment strategy and the
corresponding value function. Based on the conjecture of the
exponential-polynomial form of the value function, we prove that, when the
order of the polynomial $n\leq2$, the HJB equation has an analytical solution
if the investor with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and an
approximate solution otherwise.
